# Life

Emily told me many times, and asked if I agreed, that life is a great gift. It is. No bill is due--it is a gift--but what other word can describe it? Joy often requires adversity and sorrow. 

She did not want to die. She would get mad at cancer, want to punch it, for taking her away from you. I agree again. I was with her at the moments she got the worst news. She absolutely hated dying, because she could not watch you grow.

Emily approved of you making up your own mind. We talked about it a lot. Don't fall for all the "weak tea" in the world. She approved of you singing, dancing, expressing yourself, and being quiet or private. She told me  **respecting yourself** is the most important thing you need to do. She said each time she had not followed her gut instinct, she regretted it later. It was her gut instinct that brought me to Tacoma. She told me to tell you: Respect your gut instinct. Respect your body and your feelings. That means listening when they give you clues, and respecting your wisdom. To stand a chance at happiness, you must choose your own life. You'll be unhappy with the life others would happily choose for you.

Once Fatima came to the apartment where we all lived, by Wright Park. She really liked the place. She wondered, "How can I get a place like this?" Emily said, "First, join the Marines. Serve eight years. Then get brain cancer, and get medically retired. Easy!"

## Music is a big deal

Em enjoyed Ke$ha's openness, and willingness to express herself. We all sang her song *Tik Tok*. A life involving alcohol in partying is risky, unwise behavior, as is clowning around in a moving car with no seat belt on, but it's just a music video.

This is Ke$ha's first big hit. You sang its words. I think it was the first pop song you learned. Em liked Ke$ha's lyrics, dancing, and her attitude of playful mischief and frank openness about her feelings. Em also liked this other song by Ke$ha:

### Singing songs and poems

Em loved songs I had never heard of. She was 12 years younger than me, and listened to much more hip-hop, but she also just loved lyrics and words. We loved singing together. 

There came a time in the last 6 months of her life when she and I both sang our feelings. She said it was easier than talking about them. I agree.

Emily also loved words. She loved funny words, unusual words. This is a video we both laughed at when we first met in Mexico: *Bulbous Bouffant*

## Wonderment

I remember when Em and I took you to an exciting movie, called *Scott Pilgrim vs. the World*. You were 4. The show had 3D glasses. You were so stunned to see the people transform into super-heroes, and back. Your jaw dropped open in awe. It made us laugh. :)

Yes, you.

Oh momma.

## Striving

Here's one thing to get straight about your mother: She graduated and graduated some more. Education is the pathway to independence.

I think she told me this was a Marine friend of hers.

## There you are

This is from Melissa's wedding. I remember attending. I saw Emily there after many years of not seeing her. I saw her tattoo and asked who Chloe is. You were at that wedding, but I didn't meet you there. We didn't meet until you and Emily joined me in Mexico, a week later. You grabbed onto my head and said, "There you are!"

Emily kept this photo on her phone for a long time.

We loved camping. Twice we went to the Metow River to raft there. I brought my hammock. You got to roam around the forest campout area. (I kept an eye on you every second, because the river could really sweep a child away!) Em went rafting in a wetsuit. It's a wild river.

This is a famous painting called *The Starry Night*, by Vincent van Gogh. We're at the Museum of Modern Art, in Manhattan. They wouldn't let kids ride on shoulders so we had to carry you through the whole museum. But that was fine.

Emily's birthday. I guess that's her last birthday. That's at Aunt Melissa's house. I think she took the picture.

My family took you both to the Nutcracker while I moved my things to Tacoma. Donna made a fuss because she preferred you attend church that day. I'm glad Emily came to the performance. Perhaps some people value exceptional seasonal dance musical theater, and some people believe regular church attendance is more valuable. There are many kinds of people in the world.

Freda Everdell, who is Paula's mom, who was always there on 4th of July when we camped in Longbeach, knew what Emily wanted for you, and she stood with Emily. Paula is next to you and Emily in this picture.

When she wanted a kiss, she'd say, "Gimme some sugar!"

She was a very funny person! Total goofball.
