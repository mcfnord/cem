Fake. Emily's own views.
I don't have strong views as she
did about authenticity.
LDS,
Donna's marriage,

i read the letter he wrote aloud to 
her. I remember one key phrase of 
it. 'If for Chloe's future you 
choose a sister, family member, or 
someone else, I support your 
choice.' I had come to support her 
choice with all I could provide, and 
supported her choice actively for 18 
months after she was gone. That's 
different from one flowery sentence 
in an email. But now that I look 
back, I realize how he must have 
written that while knowing his own 
brother actively opposed her choice. 
During the trial, Pat said something 
surprising to me, that his brother 
can be vindictive. The specificity 
of that word surprised me. I have an 
enormous body of evidence 
illustrating that it's true, but I 
had come to think his family 
couldn't see it, or refused to. Pat 
comes across as cheerful and 
supportive, but he had the insight 
to choose that particular word to 
describe his brother.

It's a kind of evil when the schemes 
of vindictive men undermine freedom. 
In this letter I'll tell you what 
Emily experienced, what she said, 
and what I saw after she was gone. 
For his few words, Pat Murphy chose 
the right one to describe his 
brother. And he chose to tell Emily 
he supported her choice. I wonder if 
he said that just to persuade her. 
And I wonder if he understands what 
vindictive evil can accomplish when 
those who see it do nothing.

I am an asset to her life.

I imagine anyone in your shoes would 
choose their battles. As long as 
your brother-in-law walks the Earth, 
he's probably committed to 
undermining his daughter's wishes so 
his own can prevail. And I imagine 
you aren't idealists willing to 
oppose him, because you know he's 
vindictive. He has a serious 
psychiatric condition called 
narcissism. And I imagine you see 
yourself in his debt, because he did 
dirty things that ultimately 
expanded your family most 
positively. His work fit into your 
dream.

My mom is a Lutheran.

The truth lights paths that
illusions can't.

Chloe will know the truth. She'll 
read this letter, and an enormous 
compilation of other documents. With 
the truth of her mother's life and 
times she can find a brighter path.
She will decide who supported her,
who supported her mother, and
who sought to undermine both of
them for the cause of ego and
illusion.

These days I think about you.
I don't know if you embrace the
dark forces that brought Chloe
to your side. I know that you
always treated me with kindness.
Of course, I know Pat turned
from kindness to coldness when
each suited his plan. I know
it's easy to be a fake.
