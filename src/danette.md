Before my son had been tried and convicted of any crime, Mr. Lindquist tried to persuade Fort Lewis Army personnel to give 
my son a dishonorable discharge. Shouldn't they win their case first?

I remember all the pain and humiliation and sorrow and fear of my son's trial.

In my son's trial, we all sat, dozens of people sat, for four weeks, and we each heared a horror story of a young couple 
that ended in sorrow for many. We had to sit and endure it. And there's a reason they call it a trial. It is a trial.

Mr. Lindquist chose to risk making me endure all of it twice.

When Mr. Lindquist said on Nancy Grace that my son murdered his wife, my telephone began ringing and would not stop. I was 
frightened. But when I learned the judge saw it, I was shocked. I went from shock, to fury, and panic.

My son 
made a careless, reckless 
mistake and a beautiful young woman tragically lost her life. Every day I'm disturbed and saddened
that my son's bad decisions caused my daughter-in-law's death. But the jury and court did not convict my son of
murder. What Mr. Lindquist said on that T.V. show wasn't even true: Manslaughter is accidental. Nothing 
"added up to murder," as he put it. He couldn't even prove his claim to my son's jury.
But his choice to endanger my son's trial with speculation any juror could easily see
adds up to malfeasance of his duties to the court on a scale beyond my ken.
At exactly the moment when no prosecutor should speak to any national T.V. show about anyone facing a trial with an 
unsequestered jury in their homes and just days away from their verdict, that's when this prosecutor
welcomed Nancy Grace's questions on the air.

I know justice can be cold, and hard, and often doesn't feel like very much consolation.
But I know some forces seek to make things fairer in the world. Against liars, some tell the truth.
Against recklessness, some add safety. Against claims, some bring evidence. The Bar must hear 
evidence from people who were there, and even tried to stop Mr. Lindquist. We see how dismissive
he was toward my son's life. I hope we also see how ill the Bar Association regards such a choice.
I think that would be safe, and truthful, and fair, and would bring a tiny consolation to myself
and my son.

### Rando notes

We know from the Busto investigation that Mr. Lindquist leads his office using intimidation and fear.
His deputies carried out his vindictive schemes, or they were dismissed.

Mr. Lindquist's choices during my son's trial and even before it made me feel disgrace for Pierce County.
I felt ashamed for its people. I came to distrust the whole system Mr. Lindquist led.
He is a lawyer whose first duty is the court, but he chose to ignore that when he
fought my son in the media and gambled he'd gain more than he might lose.
My son and myself had nothing we could gain, and so much to lose, from Mr. Lindquist's choice.

But that's not even right. I had exhausted all I had saved to defend my son. If Mr. Lindquist had triggered a re-trial, 
what re-trial could there be? I could not afford that. Just one juror seeing what one judge did see on national TV would 
have convicted my son. I could not have a second trial, no matter who ruined the first.

His staff said it was a bad idea.  But he must have thought about it. But Mr. Lindquist chose to play roulette with my son 
so he could reach a national audience to chit-chat about a case he should only make to the judge and jury in the court 
room.

Mr. Lindquist likes to be in the limelight. I don't like it. But his scandal
brings my son's trial up in the news. And in the press he talks like
like none of it matters to him, or should matter to anyone. He wants to be a public person.
But to do it, he has made my family part of just one of his controversies. 

He acts like he believes he's above the law and in his mind believes the costs of 
others matter less than the potential gain of fame and attention for him.

And his defense to the Bar of his choices made it sound like no big deal.

I feel as though Skylar was charged and 
sentenced before the trial. I felt as though after all the work our team had spent, 
100â€™s of hours of professionals working on behalf of Skylar, his innocence and his 
rights; that they were acting professionally and in turn our case that was being heard 
became more of a battle than the prosecutors office foresaw it. I personally felt, and 
so did others, that ML took it upon himself to try and screw over the trial by his 
actions.  I heard with my own ears that one of the Prosecutors (not Greer) the other 
mole looking guy, state he was in the room with him during that call but than turn 
around and lie and state to the judge he knew nothing of it at first. I believe it was 
a move that was made with more than just ML.  It was not unknown I was broke at that 
point of the trial and had it been a mistrial, I would not of had the funds to go to 
round 2.  This was not a spur of the moment decision and I believe planned to sabotage 
all the man hours so many put in to defending Skylar.  It was not a case of proving his 
innocence but more of proving it was an accident. The prosecutors, esp. ML could not 
accept this fact. The fact accidents happen.  Than for ML to lie and state he was 
unaware of Nancy Grace when he previously had gone on her show a year prior. Could you 
imagine if I had done that? It made me ill thinking not only for my son but for other 
victims of this prosecutors office that did not have a fighting chance to defend 
themselves due to finances or other issues.

Reliving this is hard, very depressing to focus on my emotions I have tried to walk away from. It has made me detest and not trust in our legal system. This stems from cops to lawyers. They lie and believe they are above the law. Fact; they are not.  Our society today had become a vigil ante of sorts. Why would you trust in a corrupt legal system to do the right thing? I do not any longer!!!


# Impact Statement

Danette, I wrote a little today that
might help us get started.

A good letter is about its author.
That's you. A good letter is about what
you experienced. I'm curious about
your memories of the trial. Worst, or
perhaps best. 

A man decided to make
you risk going through that twice, not
once. And your son, and I'm sure many
other families.

I can offer some help because I was
a criminal defendent. I know how frightening,
uncertain and painful any criminal
trial is, for everyone. In his own
choices, that man decided your pain
isn't important, your son's pain,
and all the family members. It was
more important for him to get on TV.

That must infuriate you. I don't want
you to feel out of control with your
memories and the pain! Not at all.
I want to hear one or two
memories you have that make you say
"I never want to endure this again."

These are just ideas fo you. This is
your letter. If you send me
some Facebook messages, even long ones,
I can turn them into a short letter or
long one. All up to you.

## A trial is traumatic for a lot of people

A trial involves a large number of people. 
There are lawyers, and jurors, experts, 
court reporters, and sheriffs in every 
courtroom. These people might care, and 
might be good people, but they aren't among 
the families whose lives are already 
permanently changed, and for whom the trial 
details will burn forever in memories. For a 
smaller group of people, those impacted by 
the facts of the trial, a trial is 
traumatic. The events that came before were 
all traumatic, but the trial is an 
additional trauma, where evidence and 
testimony twists and confuses and 
often re-traumatizes those who lived
through the events. The Bar rules
are meant to protect people who are
already enduring a saga of pain.	

## Mark risked triggering a second trial

The Bar's rules try to protect
the families, and try to protect
the enormous committment of time and
effort to assure jurors only hear
the evidence the court has deemed fair.

## His high profile compounds the pain

When an elected official breaks rules, the 
people must be informed. Many people took 
action when Mr. Lindquist endangered my 
son's trial. A recall by voters kept my 
son's trial in the headlines long after it 
was decided by the jury. When Mr. Fogg 
downplays the seriousness of these 
violations, he is saying the long-running 
impact felt by me, my family, and all family 
involved does not matter. 
Mr. Fogg says  
insulting things
to try and get Mr. Lindquist out of trouble just insult me, and belittle me, and try to tell me what Mr. Lindquist did doesn't really matter.
