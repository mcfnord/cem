To whom it may concern,

In _State of Washington v Nemetz_, my son was convicted of manslaughter.
My son made a careless, reckless mistake and a beautiful 
young woman tragically lost her life. Every day I'm 
disturbed and saddened that my son's bad decisions caused my 
daughter-in-law's death.

Before my son had been tried and convicted of any crime, Mr. 
Lindquist tried to persuade Fort Lewis Army personnel to 
give my son a dishonorable discharge. Shouldn't they win 
their case first?

My son did not murder his wife. 
When Mr. Lindquist said on _Nancy Grace_ that my son murdered his 
wife, my telephone began ringing and would not stop. I was 
frightened. When I learned the judge saw it, I was shocked, and furious. I felt panicked.

I remember all the pain, humiliation and sorrow I felt in my 
son's trial. For four weeks, we all sat, dozens of people 
sat, and we each heard a horror story of a 
young couple that ended in sorrow for many. We had to sit 
and endure all the horrible details.

Mr. Lindquist chose to risk making every one of us who 
endured the trial have to endure it all over again.

I know justice can be hard. It rarely feels
like very much consolation. But I know some seek to 
make things fairer in the world. Against liars, some tell 
the truth. Against danger, some add safety. Against claims, 
some bring evidence. 
Mark Lindquist's advisors told him not to go on T.V., and not
to answer certain questions, but 
he was 
dismissive toward my son's fate, and dismissive toward
the cause of justice. I hope against 
his recklessness, some bring justice.
