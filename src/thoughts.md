## Joyce Robson

Joyce is an adoption attorney who prepared the adoption paperwork for John and Emily. Joyce (Joy) viewed both John and Emily as her clients, and initially thought the adoption would sail through. Joy had limited contact with Kyle Coker and made no representations to him about Emily's health. (Coker alleges that no one told him Emily was dying.) According to Joy things started to go sideways when Emily's family became involved. Joy attended a meeting with Joni Irvin, Darin Murphy, Donna Mairs, Jan Dempsey, John and Emily, during which Darin apparently dominated the meeting. Joy thought Darin was the most domineering person she had ever met, and that he was demeaning to his dying daughter, Emily. Joy thought that Jan Dempsey was a voice of reason. Nevertheless, the allegations regarding sexual abuse were sufficient to shake Joni Irvin's confidence in the adoption. Candace Zygar also sent Joni a letter, indicating her reservations about it. Joni apparently told Joy that the court would have to decide whether an adoption was in Chloe's best interest. In any event, Joy asked Joni not to issue a home study or any type of report because she was concerned it would be a negative one. Heather Young refers to the adoption process as a "failed adoption." Joy disagrees with that description because no home study/report was issued. Joy recently dismissed the adoption petition without prejudice.

## Howard Dempsey

Howard is John's paternal uncle. Howard is a retired educator. Many of the supervised visitations have taken place at Howard's home, so he can testify regarding his observations of the bond between Chloe and John. He will be a good witness.


## Jason Dempsey

Jason is John's half brother. Jason has shared custody of his own 13-year-old daughter Ebona. After relinquishing the apartment in Tacoma that he had shared with Emily and Chloe, John moved into Jason's home in SeaTac. Jason can testify regarding John's relationship with Chloe.

## John Sterbick, J.D. 

John Sterbick had done some legal work for John Dempsey years ago. In the present case, however, he witnessed a statement that Emily signed regarding her wishes for John to have custody of Chloe. John Sterbick went to John and Emily's apartment and will testify that she was competent and clear with respect to her wishes. Curiously, John Sterbick dated Candacy Zygar for about 4 years, I think shortly after she was out of law school.

## Jeris Underwood

Jeris Underwood is John Sterbick's paralegal. (There is some odd connection between Jeris Underwood and John Dempsey's mother; Underwood was named after her but I do not believe that Underwood knows the Dempsey family.) Jeris signed a declaration regarding her observations of Emily Murphy, and will testify that Emily was competent and clear with respect to wanting John Dempsey to have custody of Chloe.
