Kyle Coker

Wholly unfit based on a pattern of emotional abuse and neglect toward
the child at critical junctures in her life.

---------------------------

21. Kyle should get lost. 
--------------------------

Any relationship with Chloe Murphy should be either at her initiation or
carefully screened by invested parties, unless and until Mr. Coker shows
a pattern of commitment, which contrasts with the harmful pattern or
broken promises he has shown in her life so far.

22. What facts support my position in \#21? What facts rebut it?
----------------------------------------------------------------

> Emily called Kyle a coward. There is no room for cowards here. His
> words paint all sorts of pictures, but his deeds show just one. He
> gives every indication of a desire to be free of this legal status,

REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION \#10:
----------------------------

-   Back support total.

-   Statement of intent to visit child during… failure. That’s abuse.

-   Email seeking relationship with Chloe, failed to follow through.

-   Pleading only specifying interactions with his mom, not him.

-   Pleading alleging “love with all \[his\] heart” markedly
    inconsistent with behavior.

-   

23. Please state the times during the past five (5) years when you have had primary parenting responsibility for Chloe Murphy and the amount of time you spent with her each week: 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> I define “primary parenting responsibility” as the provision of food,
> sanitation, safety, financial and emotional support (which Chloe,
> Emily, and I referred to as "love"), without compensation for labor or
> reimbursement for expense.
>
> For 5 years, Emily Murphy sought my active role as Chloe’s dad.
>
> Emily’s disability also necessitated my intentional focus on both
> logistics and day-to-day operations. I planned travel and day trips
> based on mobility and (later) stamina limits. During 2013, her stamina
> diminished, and she began sleeping and needing sleep or naps more
> frequently. During 2014, dizziness emerged until hospice medications
> began.
>
> When Chloe occupied my house, whether Emily was present or not, I
> prepared well in advance, steam-cleaning all carpets, gathering
> healthy and delicious food, and having clean linens ready.
>
> My parenting began before the word ‘dad’ was used. While together in
> Seattle, Emily supported our family designation from an early point,
> where I am Chloe's dad. Specifically, when Emily and I were
> separating, Emily told Chloe that I am Chloe's dad. I also said this
> to Chloe. For the prior year, when Chloe was 2, I preferred to just be
> John. However, my behavior as a primary parent began as soon as Chloe
> came into my life.
>
> While together in Seattle, we relied on my apartment, resources and
> planning, as well as my physical ability.
>
> While together in Tacoma, Emily had less strength, balance, and
> stamina, and we relied on my resources and planning, and my ability to
> drive (which she lacked).
>
> While dining out or paying a bill, especially a bill involving Chloe,
> Emily and I paid in rough parity.
>
> When paying a car rental bill, I paid, and there were many.
>
> When travelling with Emily, I'd always pump the gas, so I'd always pay
> for the gas, too.
>
> In 2014, in our household finances, Emily and I paid equally in finer
> parity.
>
> During these periods of time, Chloe relied on my provision of food,
> sanitation, safety, financial and emotional support (which Chloe,
> Emily, and I referred to as "love").
>
> This qualifies me as a de facto parent. The designation "primary"
> parent is misleading and not relevant to the question before the
> court.
>
> During Chloe’s 2^nd^ year, us three spent most weekends and all major
> holidays together. We travelled together for x weeks.
>
> Review evidence and infer time commitment in both interaction and
> preparation necessary. Review videos, photos, and other records. Also
> paste from GAL records, maybe.

24. I’m available consistently on weekdays before 9am and after 2pm, and throughout the weekend. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

25. Division of parenting responsibility. 
------------------------------------------

> Throughout
>
> Equal and high commitment to and provision of: wonder, safety,
> memories, inspiration, examples
>
> 26\. Substantially fewer spankings and no underhanded psychology.
>
> 2009
>
> 2010
>
> 2011
>
> 2012
>
> 2013
>
> 2014
>
> A lot of spankings maintained with the court, with precise rationale,
> date, time, and apparent outcome.
>
> 27\. Greater awareness of nutrition and greater awareness around treats
> vs. healthy snacks. No more food reward behavior!
>
> 28\. In practice, I am able to engage with Child actively in parks, on
> bikes, etc.
>
> For example, in 2013, my sister Jan and her husband Tom took Chloe,
> Ally, and me to Zoo Lights while Donna and Richard Mairs stayed home.
> I have invited Donna Mairs to join me during many visits, and she has
> declined. Perhaps she is repulsed by me, or perhaps in practice her
> energy level renders her opinion about physical activities moot.

29. Do we differ on Medical, Dental, and Counseling care? 
----------------------------------------------------------

> Chloe has benefitted from counseling designed for creative children,
> because she is an unusually creative child. The Mairs have removed her
> from counseling programs long-established by Emily and me for Chloe’s
> mental and emotional health at this time. I strongly differ with the
> Mairs on the prudence of these decisions.
>
> Based on the declaration of Katy Johnson, where she made no effort to
> investigate an allegation of child pornography before reporting both a
> mandatory reporter claim and making a medical judgement, and based on
> Donna Mairs’ receipt of counseling from same, I doubt the impartiality
> and judgement of Katy Johnson to see serious indicators of emotional
> sickness in her client, Donna Mairs.

30. Do we differ on hygiene and environmental needs?
----------------------------------------------------

> Richard has too much stuff. The route to the rear door has been very
> unsafe for many ears. I can’t believe the G.A.L. didn’t mention it.
> The place has gone downhill since he moved in. Sorry, Richard, but
> it’s true! I know you’re emotional about the stuff your dad left you.
>
> I don’t consider evening news to be healthy for daily viewing, fraught
> with alarmist rhetoric and real suffering as it is.
>
> I am not aware of a rich musical foundation in the Mairs home that
> results in helpful music on a daily basis.

31. Do we differ on spiritual, moral, and religious needs?
----------------------------------------------------------

> We must have substantial differences, as I consider the position of
> the Intervenors through every hearing to be spiritually bankrupt and
> morally dubious. I also saw claims of religiosity used to crush love.
>
> I also consider Intervener willingness to hire ethically challenged
> counsel to suggest a failure of spiritual and moral precepts in their
> lives.

32. Special schools, 
---------------------

Grant Center for the Expressive Arts
------------------------------------

Lowell Elementary
-----------------

Bryant Montessori School
------------------------

33. Do we differ on social needs?
---------------------------------

> Chloe has an entire family who she knows and misses. Donna Mairs has
> willfully prevented Chloe from seeing these people. Donna has also
> spoken poorly of many of them to Chloe. I object to this alienation
> effort. See \#37
>
> There is no supporting reason, and exist substantial reasons opposing
> Donna Mairs consistent prohibition of adult members of my family
> seeing Chloe.

34. Relocations of that distance are unlikely in that time frame. 
------------------------------------------------------------------

35. My schedule is more conducive to caring for the child, Chloe Murphy:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

> I have a very flexible schedule. For example, I cared for Chloe Murphy
> and her dying mother for 6 months, putting aside other matters. I can
> just as easily not work a particular 6 hours as a particular 6 months.
> Financial planning, a high wage, and professional skills make this
> possible. Furthermore, my own schedule is augmented by the
> availability of three other experienced care-givers in my home.

36. Please state who is more likely to reside on the child’s, Chloe Murphy’s, current school distract and why: 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Donna Mairs has resided in the same home since I met her 27 years ago.
> I am open to relocation when the decision makes great sense. However,
> I am unlikely to reside in the Tacoma School District as much greater
> work opportunities exist in the greater Seattle area. I could reside
> in Tacoma School District again, as circumstances require, for short
> or longer terms. I have substantial family support in that geographic
> area and some work is available for me.

37. Who abused Chloe: 
----------------------

> A.U., a minor child,
>
> Donna Mairs,
>
> Darin Murphy

38. Please state how Emily Murphy consented to and fostered your relationship with the child, Chloe Murphy: 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Emily welcomed my involvement in Chloe’s life as soon as I met Chloe.
> Emily showed this by leaving Chloe in my care for short and longer
> periods, and ultimately by assuring Chloe was in my sole care even
> when Emily and I had a weak relationship. Her consent was implicit in
> her commitment to fostering the ongoing relationship through concrete
> efforts. When together, Emily, Chloe and I referred to ourselves as a
> “family,” engaged in “family hugs,” attended school functions
> together, travelled together, and lived together in weekend,
> international stay, and full-time time periods.
>
> Emily consented to and fostered my relationship as future sole
> care-giver by instructing me on on how I was to raise Chloe. Emily’s
> strong teaching was:

1.  Chloe must respect herself.

2.  Parenting distills to: love, patience, and love.

3.  No 16-year-old girl should attend Burning Man.

> Even where I might differ, I defer to Emily, knowing I owe my
> fatherhood to her.
>
> During 2013, Emily refused my persuasion that Darin Murphy’s home
> represented Chloe’s best option, insisting consistently through 4
> contacts with counsel in 2013 that she wished for me to be Chloe’s
> guardian. Even when Emily and I separated, Emily prioritized keeping
> me in Chloe’s life through day and overnight activities. Emily and I
> bathed with Chloe as a young child. Emily resisted a concerted,
> abusive effort by her mother, father, and various cohorts to dissuade
> her or stop her from consenting to and fostering my relationship with
> the child. That’s commitment to my relationship with the child, Chloe
> Murphy.
>
> 39\. Kyle Coker initially had concluded, based on Emily’s information,
> that I am Chloe’s dad.
>
> Mr. Coker told me and told Emily, “You are the dad,” referring to me.
> He signed away his parental rights to me. He verbally consented to
> 3^rd^ party custodianship to Alece Cox. He initially strongly rejected
> Darin Murphy’s interference, and spoke poorly of him.
>
> 40\. Emily and I split most travel expenses, including splitting costs
> for Chloe. When Emily and Chloe were with me in Seattle, my house was
> always clean, and my refrigerator was full of healthy, delicious food.
> When travelling with them in the United States by rental car, I paid
> this cost. When co-habitating, all costs were split 50-50, including
> expenses of Chloe, with these exceptions: Emily paid Chloe’s medical
> insurance, while I paid all costs associated with gaining custody of
> Chloe. When she was in my custody I took steps to add her to my
> insurance.
>
> During the last 6 months of Emily’s life, I did not work outside the
> home. I worked inside the home during a crash course in advanced
> nursing. During this time, I also was closely involved in Chloe’s
> life, providing 6 months of skilled labor to them at no charge. Emily
> and Chloe had been close to me through many years of laboring, and I
> routinely spent money on their happiness prior to tri-habitation among
> us 3, and while I split expenses with Emily while tri-habitating, I
> provided 24-hour skilled labor to Emily and extensive parental support
> to Chloe.
>
> For example, Emily and I purchased tickets to the dog show, where
> Donna and Chloe watched trick pups perform. I’ve arranged many trips
> to the zoo and paid the gate, or shared the cost with Emily. I paid
> for half of Chloe’s 5^th^ birthday party. I don’t remember who paid
> for her 3^rd^ in Mexico, but I probably participated financially. I
> bought her a scooter. I paid so she could go swimming all summer when
> she was 5. I gassed many cars over many years to move people around,
> including Chloe’s two older cousins. When dining at a restaurant or
> café’, which was a very common for us over very many years, we
> switched and shared financial responsibilities over time. While Emily
> paid a small part of the airfare for Chloe’s last trip to Mexico, I
> paid all lodging and dining expenses for myself and for Chloe. All
> camping expenses were my purchases, except Emily had her own sleeping
> bag and one for Chloe. Since Chloe was taken into custody by the
> state, I have visited her over many days observed by professionals,
> and over those many hours I provided completely for her through
> concrete financial support. I have done these things through her life
> when she’s with me.

> Maya was a good friend at Jefferson Elementary. I have a nice photo of

> that name. What are the names of Chloe’s friends from Seattle? Would
