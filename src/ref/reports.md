Brief Outline of Visitation


This report is in reference to the supervised visitation between John Dempsey and Chloe Murphy. The visit took place in Tacoma, Washington, beginning at the Tacoma Link Theater District station.

The supervisor parked her vehicle at 1:56pm and proceeded to the sidewalk, several yards away from the Theater District station. The supervisor noticed Chloe waving from the vehicle parked nearby. The supervisor waited on the sidewalk and greeted the grandmother, who had opened her car door to greet the supervisor. The supervisor asked the grandmother if she felt comfortable allowing Chloe to walk with her to the Theater District station, several yards away. The grandmother was comfortable with this, and asked Chloe if she had her umbrella, before saying goodbye. Chloe had her umbrella, greeted the supervisor, and said goodbye to her grandmother.

The supervisor walked with Chloe to the Theater District station where they met Mr. Dempsey at 1:57pm as a trolley was pulling up to the station. Chloe greeted Mr. Dempsey by calling out ‘Daddy!’ Chloe continued to call Mr. Dempsey ‘Daddy’ and ‘Dad’ for the duration of the visit. Mr. Dempsey directed Chloe onto the trolley where they found a seat and sat down together. Chloe compared umbrellas with Mr. Dempsey and asked Mr. Dempsey to dance with
 
her in the aisle before the trolley began to move. Mr. Dempsey danced next to Chloe and directed her to sit when the trolley began to move. When the trolley reached the Union station, Mr. Dempsey directed Chloe off the trolley where they walked to the sidewalk to decide where
to go next. Chloe asked Mr. Dempsey if they could visit the university bookstore. Mr. Dempsey agreed, instructing Chloe that they could look around the bookstore but that they would not be purchasing any items. Chloe and Mr. Dempsey looked around the bookstore together. As they were browsing, Chloe turned to Mr. Dempsey, handed him a bracelet from her wrist, and told
Mr. Dempsey that she had made a friendship bracelet for him. Mr. Dempsey put the bracelet on his wrist and leaned down to kiss Chloe on the forehead, thanking her for the gift.

When they were finished browsing the bookstore, Mr. Dempsey suggested that they look for another store to visit. Chloe walked outside with Mr. Dempsey and Mr. Dempsey asked Chloe if she was hungry. Chloe asked Mr. Dempsey if they could have pho. Mr. Dempsey agreed, and directed Chloe down the street to a pho restaurant. When they arrived, Mr. Dempsey ordered a large chicken pho soup to share with Chloe and together they sat down next to each other at a table. The supervisor sat across from Chloe. Mr. Dempsey pulled out a Ranger Rick magazine from his bag and together he and Chloe looked through the magazine as they waited
for their food to arrive. When they were finished reading the Ranger Rick magazine, Mr. Dempsey asked Chloe if she wanted to continue writing their story about ‘Sparkles’. When Chloe agreed, Mr. Dempsey pulled out a notebook and began adding to it, as Chloe told him what to write. When the food arrived, Mr. Dempsey separated the soup into two bowls. Chloe and Mr. Dempsey ate together at the table. At one point, Mr. Dempsey told Chloe that Jeris’ husband had passed away. Chloe listened as Mr. Dempsey explained that he had spent the night with her the day before, but did not comment. Mr. Dempsey told Chloe that Jeris was looking
forward to Chloe’s visit on Sunday. When they were finished eating, Mr. Dempsey paid for their meal and then directed Chloe back outside.

Once outside, Mr. Dempsey asked Chloe if she wanted to go to a nearby café. Chloe walked with Mr. Dempsey and asked if they could look at an art store. Mr. Dempsey agreed, and together they walked to the art store. When they arrived, and realized the art store was closed, Mr. Dempsey directed Chloe to a coffeehouse called Anthem, across the street. Mr. Dempsey asked Chloe if she would like hot tea. Chloe agreed, and decided on a berry-flavored tea. Mr.
 
Dempsey purchased the tea, as well as a blackberry scone to share. Mr. Dempsey and Chloe sat down at the coffee bar and Chloe asked Mr. Dempsey to look up a video on his phone called
‘Bean Boozled’. The video was about several individuals tasting various flavors of jellybeans, and was age appropriate. Chloe and Mr. Dempsey watched the video, and after several minutes, decided to move to a table across the room, where it was not as loud. Chloe and Mr. Dempsey watched the video together and shared the tea and scone.

When they were finished at Anthem, Mr. Dempsey directed Chloe outside and asked if she wanted to visit a nearby park. Chloe agreed and together they began walking down Pacific Avenue. As they were walking, Mr. Dempsey suggested they go across the street and wait for the trolley instead. Chloe agreed and together they walked to the Union station. When they
arrived, Chloe walked onto a landscaped portion of the Pacific Avenue median. Chloe asked Mr. Dempsey to pretend they were dinosaurs. Mr. Dempsey played with Chloe on the median.
When Chloe began to walk further onto the median, Mr. Dempsey followed. The supervisor noticed a sign several yards onto the median that said ‘No Trespassing’. The supervisor pointed out the sign to Mr. Dempsey and instructed him to redirect Chloe back to the station. Mr. Dempsey called for Chloe and together they returned to the Union station. Mr. Dempsey told Chloe they would walk to the park to play instead. The supervisor informed Mr. Dempsey that she was unfamiliar with the Link trolley system, reminded him that it was 3:40pm and asked if he thought they would have enough time to visit the park and return to board the trolley in time to make it back to the Theater District station by 4:00pm. Mr. Dempsey decided to board the next trolley, instead of visiting the park.

The trolley arrived at the Theater District station at 3:45pm. When Chloe exited the trolley, she noticed her grandmother parking nearby.

This visit was held at Mr. Dempsey’s Paternal Uncle’s home, Howard Dempsey. No other visitors attended. Howard was present in the home during the visit and periodically engaged with Mr. Dempsey and Chloe.
I met Maternal Grandmother and Chloe outside the residence. Maternal Grandmother stated that due to the rain, Chloe did not bring her helmet to ride the mini-horse Nicholas. Maternal Grandmother reminded Chloe of the turkey activity she had brought to share with Mr. Dempsey. Maternal Grandmother gave Chloe her jacket and said goodbye with hugs. Chloe and I made our way to the front door of the residence where we met Mr. Dempsey and Howard.
Chloe immediately showed Mr. Dempsey the turkey activity she had brought. Mr. Dempsey, Howard, and Chloe greeted with smiles. I informed Mr. Dempsey that Chloe had not brought her helmet to ride Nicholas. Mr. Dempsey and Howard both stated that was okay, as it had been raining.
All of us made our way to the lower level of the house. Mr. Dempsey and Chloe sat on the floor next to the fireplace and began working on activities. Mr. Dempsey asked Chloe how
 
school was going. They had general conversation about animals. Mr. Dempsey, Chloe, and I went upstairs.

This report is in reference to the supervised visitation between John Dempsey and a child, Chloe Murphy. John Dempsey is fic of kin not a biological family member to this child. Therefore, John Dempsey will be referred to as Mr. Dempsey or John throughout this report. Maternal Grandmother and Chloe were waiting by the statue on the sidewalk down from the Tacoma Arts Museum. Maternal Grandmother asked if she were to pay for parking. I informed her all payments are handled through our office. Maternal Grandmother and Chloe said goodbye with hugs. Chloe ran after Maternal Grandmother as she was walking away to hug her again. After Maternal Grandmother left the area, Chloe asked to see John. I told Chloe we would wait there for him, and that he should be along shortly. We were a few minutes early before the visit was scheduled to start. After a few minutes, Mr. Dempsey poked his head out from behind a
wall near us.  I motioned to Chloe where Mr. Dempsey was located. Chloe and I walked to Mr. Dempsey and they both greeted with hugs and smiles. Mr. Dempsey began to pull out money and count it.  I informed Mr. Dempsey the parking fee would be handled through our office. He said okay and put the money back into his pocket.
Mr. Dempsey said he wanted to take Chloe somewhere for this visit. As we began walking down the sidewalk Chloe began to hang on Mr. Dempsey’s arm. Chloe stated she was hungry and she would like to eat Pho. Mr. Dempsey said they could eat first, then they would go to the place he had in mind for the visit. When we came to the crosswalk, Chloe asked Mr.
 
Dempsey to carry her. Mr. Dempsey said no she could walk and he would walk with her. We crossed the street and Chloe asked to see a statue. We walked to the statue where they conversed about the symbols around the bottom. After a few moments we walked to a nearby Pho restaurant.  Chloe sat next to Mr. Dempsey and read to herself. After they ordered and the food arrived, Mr. Dempsey read aloud to Chloe. While eating dinner Chloe explained to Mr.
Dempsey how she had broken her glasses and did not want him to be disappointed in her. Mr. Dempsey told her accidents happen and he was not disappointed in her. Chloe said she wished she had never tried to bend the stem of the glasses to adjust them because that is how she broke them. After finishing their Pho we left the restaurant and Chloe said she wanted to visit UW. Mr. Dempsey said no, they had gone there during the last visit he had another place in mind that she would really like. As we began to cross the street Mr. Dempsey began to give Chloe instructions on how to cross the street. Chloe began to make noises and did not respond. Mr. Dempsey shushed her and gave instruction as to how to safely cross the street.
We made our way to the Tacoma Art Museum where Chloe and Mr. Dempsey walked through the exhibits conversing about them. Mr. Dempsey then took Chloe to an area where they could draw and color. Mr. Dempsey and Chloe drew pictures and colored them. Mr. Dempsey wrote, “Life is an opportunity and Love is a choice”. Mr. Dempsey asked Chloe what she thought of his quote, Chloe said she loved it. Mr. Dempsey and Chloe drew each other’s faces on a transparent board. Then they played make believe with wooden horse sculptures.
Mr. Dempsey and Chloe then sat down at the drawing table where they had left their drawings and belongings. Chloe began to draw on her previous pictures and Mr. Dempsey began to draw on a picture left by another person. Chloe noticed Mr. Dempsey drawing on someone else’s picture and told Mr. Dempsey he was not supposed to do that it belonged to someone else.  Mr. Dempsey said the person did not want it they had left it. He said it was okay to add to someone else’s work if they leave it behind. Chloe said oh okay. Mr. Dempsey informed Chloe it was almost time to leave. Chloe continued to draw and then wanted to do other activities. Mr. Dempsey told her it was time to go, as they did not have time for other activities. He asked her to finish up so they could leave.
We left the Tacoma Art Museum and started to the meeting location. After we were fairly close to the location, Mr. Dempsey asked Chloe for a hug goodbye as it was time to part ways. Chloe and Mr. Dempsey hugged. Mr. Dempsey had his forearms around Chloe’s
 
shoulders and started to sway back and forth in a rocking motion while hugging her. Chloe moved away and started talking about the toy turkey he had given her. We walked a few more steps and Mr. Dempsey asked Chloe for another hug goodbye. Chloe hugged Mr. Dempsey with one arm and continued to talk about her toy turkey.
I noticed Chloe was not wearing her glasses - remembering that she had taken them off to draw faces on transparent board. I asked Chloe where her glasses were. We all agreed they were left in the art room. I told Mr. Dempsey to quickly back to get them and I would stay with
Chloe. Mr. Dempsey left to get the glasses and I looked at the time it was 6:44 pm. I saw

Maternal Grandmother waiting at the meeting location. I walked Chloe to Maternal

Grandmother and explained what happened and that Mr. Dempsey would be bringing the glasses back, which I would get from him and return to her. Maternal Grandmother asked if Mr. Dempsey had given me any mail. I said he had not mentioned it, I would ask.
I saw Mr. Dempsey returning from the Tacoma Arts Museum. I walked down the sidewalk and met him. I asked Mr. Dempsey about any mail when he handed me the glasses, he shook his head and said no he had none. I told Mr. Dempsey because of the time I had already returned Chloe to Maternal Grandmother. He said ok he understood. I returned the glasses to Maternal Grandmother and Chloe then I left the area.

Place: Union Station, Tacoma Time: 4:45pm - 6:45pm Supervisor: Christine
Person Requesting Report: Both Parties



Brief Outline of Visitation

This report is in reference to the supervised visitation between John Dempsey and a child, Chloe Murphy.
The visit was held in downtown Tacoma, meeting the grandmother, Donna, at the Union Station. I arrived a few minutes early and met John close to the exchange location. I introduced myself to John. He indicated that he would wait a short distance down the street. Donna arrived on time. I introduced myself to her and to Chloe, explaining that I was filling in for Charlotte. Chloe appeared to be okay with my presence, she quickly looked down the street, and seeing John, she hurried towards him calling out "Daddy...Daddy". The greeted each other with hugs. Chloe appeared very excited to see John and quickly showed him her new book. She told him the book was about dinosaurs.
John asked Chloe if she was hungry. When Chloe did not respond, he told her that he was very hungry and suggested they go to the local Pho restaurant for soup. Chloe agreed with John's suggestion. On the way to the restaurant, John and Chloe discussed Chloe's new clothing including new boots, adding up the costs for the clothes, the weather, the chance for snow, and how it is colder when the sky is clear. John praised Chloe after she quickly added up the costs for her clothing. Chloe followed John's lead in crossing Pacific Avenue.
 
Once inside the restaurant, John asked Chloe for her preference in food choices. They decided on soup with chicken and noodles and rolls. While eating, Chloe asked John to read to her. As John was reading, he noticed Chloe's bookmarker. It was a library index card for the author, Oralee Wachter. The name of the book on the card was "Close to Home" and the subject matter was child molestation, safety education, 1986. John stated that he found Chloe's bookmarker interesting and handed it to me. John did not appear overly concerned - indicting that the markers are probably randomly given out. He asked Chloe if she got her book from school. She indicated she got the book from the library. As John read to Chloe, she pointed out certain words and asked him to read a particular number of pages. John inserted inflection as he read to Chloe and Chloe appeared to follow along intently. She appeared completely focused on the readings. When they reached a page containing a picture of underwear, Chloe appeared to find this amusing as she laughed and repeated the word, "underwear" a few times. During dinner, Chloe asked John to help her use chopsticks. John showed her how and then said that it was okay if she could not use chop sticks right away, because sometimes it takes time. John added that there were forks for her to use. He then put some mild hot sauce in the soup and
when Chloe stated that she wanted more soup without hot sauce, John explained to her that he only added a small amount and suggested she try it. Chloe tried the soup and told John that she liked it. During dinner, John asked Chloe how school was going and about her multiplication tables including some easy numbers for her to multiply. Chloe gave John numerous hugs. She called him "daddy". John talked about Chloe's mother and when Chloe was little. He asked Chloe if she wanted to see his uncle to which she replied, "yes".
After dinner, they decided to go to the UW Store and maybe find something to buy. Chloe wanted to jog so John and I jogged behind her, until we reached the store. Once inside, John and Chloe investigated many items, discussing how each works, trying some out, commenting on what each of them would like. John gave Chloe a $10 budget. When Chloe found something for John, she told him he could buy it but added that it would not be coming out of her money. Chloe stated this in a teasing manner. They purchased a few items and then decided to go inside the main UW building. Chloe said she wanted to go somewhere where "no one can see us".
 
Once inside the building, John and Chloe played "statue" and then proceeded to a snack machine where Chloe purchased a candy bar from her remaining change. She counted out the money and told John that she wanted to share the candy with him. John took a small piece and they continued to the elevator, stopping at the second floor.
John and Chloe explored the building and came to an empty office space where they proceeded to play numerous make-believe games. John followed Chloe's lead, even doing cartwheels and other exercises per her request. They did various Yoga moves, stretches, pretended to be different animals, and appeared to have a good time together. Both John and Chloe used imagination during their play.
At approximately 6:25pm, I reminded John that we were getting close to the end of the visit. John told Chloe that they needed to begin to walk back to the meeting location. Chloe said she did not want the visit to end. On the way out of the building, Chloe told John that her lips were hurting and asked if he would buy her something to put on the lips. They stopped at the
UW snack store where John purchased some lip balm for Chloe. She thanked him for the purchase and they continued toward the exit - reaching the exit at 6:35pm they decided to spend the remaining minutes with John reading to Chloe. As he read, John looked up at me to see how we were doing on time. At 6:40pm, I motioned to him that it was time to go.
We walked outside the building and Chloe again followed John's directions in crossing the street. As they waited for the second light to turn green, they played on some rocks. I saw Donna standing in front of the Union Station. At approximately 6:43pm, John said good-bye to Chloe, gave her a hug, and told her he would see her on Sunday. As John walked away, Chloe yelled out that she loved him more than anything in the world.
I escorted Chloe to Donna for the exchange. There were no incidents during this visit

Brief Outline of Visitation


This report is in reference to the supervised visitation between John Dempsey and Chloe

Murphy. The visit took place at Cosmonaut Coffee, located in Tacoma, Washington.

The supervisor met Chloe and the grandmother on the corner of Division and N.  I Street at 7:00pm. Chloe appeared to be walking slowly, and the grandmother told the supervisor that a dog had just bitten Chloe, prior to leaving for the visit. The grandmother explained that she had already cleaned and bandaged the wound, and had talked with Chloe about whether or not the visit should continue. The grandmother told the supervisor that she was comfortable allowing Chloe to attend the visit and would keep her phone on her, should Chloe decide she needed to leave the visit early, due to pain. The supervisor asked Chloe if she was comfortable continuing with the visit. When Chloe agreed, the supervisor told Chloe that at any point if she felt like she needed to go home, she could let her know and they would call her grandmother immediately. Chloe agreed and said goodbye to her grandmother.
The supervisor held Chloe’s hand and together they walked across the street to Cosmonaut Coffee. Mr. Dempsey came outside to the stairs and greeted Chloe. The supervisor explained to Mr. Dempsey what had happened and Mr. Dempsey directed Chloe inside, comforting her and asking her about what had happened. Mr. Dempsey directed Chloe to a bar stool near the window and sat down next to her. Mr. Dempsey noted that Chloe was shaking and
 
asked her if she was okay. Chloe told him she was okay and that she didn’t think she would be able to walk around the neighborhood because of the pain. Mr. Dempsey told Chloe they would take it easy and that if she didn’t want to go trick or treating, they didn’t have to. Mr. Dempsey hugged Chloe and together they talked about the incident. When they were finished talking about the incident, Chloe showed Mr. Dempsey the basket she had brought and together they talked about a new movie that Chloe wanted to see. Chloe asked Mr. Dempsey if they could see the movie together and Mr. Dempsey told Chloe that they might be able to see the movie during a future visit. Chloe asked Mr. Dempsey if she could see pictures of her room. Mr. Dempsey agreed and showed her several pictures on his phone. When Chloe asked to see pictures of Mr. Dempsey’s room, Mr. Dempsey explained to Chloe that he could not show her pictures of his room, but that it was okay for her to look at pictures of her own room.
As they were looking at the pictures, Chloe told Mr. Dempsey: ‘Pat really wants to adopt me, and they have a little boy’. Mr. Dempsey listened to Chloe as she talked about Pat, and then agreed that they indeed had a little boy. Mr. Dempsey then pulled out several items from his
bag, including a chicken mask, several toy swords, and some pipe cleaners. Together they played with the items for several minutes. When they were finished playing with the items, Mr. Dempsey suggested they walk across the street for a sandwich. Chloe told Mr. Dempsey she wasn’t sure how far she could walk. Mr. Dempsey told Chloe they would walk slowly and then directed her outside. When they got outside, Chloe told Mr. Dempsey she was cold. Mr. Dempsey gave Chloe his coat and together they walked across the street to Subway. When they arrived, Mr. Dempsey directed Chloe to a nearby table and instructed her to sit down while he ordered them a ham sandwich. Chloe sat down at the table and the supervisor sat at a nearby table, across from Chloe. Mr. Dempsey gave Chloe a laser pointer and then went to order the sandwich. As Mr. Dempsey was ordering, Chloe told the supervisor about school and her favorite candy. When Mr. Dempsey returned, he and Chloe ate the ham sandwich together. As they ate, Chloe played with the laser pointer and then asked Mr. Dempsey if they could go trick or treating. Mr. Dempsey encouraged Chloe to eat a few more bites of her sandwich and then wrapped up what was left and walked with Chloe outside.
Mr. Dempsey directed Chloe into a nearby neighborhood and together they began looking for houses that had their lights turned on. Chloe played with the laser pointer as they walked. Several times, Mr. Dempsey stopped to ask Chloe how her leg was feeling. Chloe
 
explained that her leg felt stiff, but that she was feeling better. Many of the houses in the neighborhood were dark. Mr. Dempsey and Chloe continued to walk until they found houses that were lit. At one point, Mr. Dempsey received a phone call from Herb. Mr. Dempsey answered the call and put it on speaker. Mr. Dempsey explained to Herb that he and Chloe were currently trick or treating and about to knock on a door. Herb told Mr. Dempsey that he would call Mr. Dempsey later and then said goodbye. Mr. Dempsey put his phone away and continued walking with Chloe. Chloe was able to visit several houses and after she had gotten several pieces of candy, asked Mr. Dempsey if they could sit down and eat a few pieces together. Mr. Dempsey agreed, and directed Chloe to a set of steps that were well lit. Mr. Dempsey sat with Chloe and together they ate several pieces of candy and Chloe opened a Capri Sun juice she had received from a nearby house. When they were finished, Chloe saw a couple of girls who were close in age and asked Mr. Dempsey if she could follow them. One of the mothers of the girls explained that they were almost done for the night, but that if Chloe wanted to join them for a few houses, she was welcome to. Chloe followed the girls for several minutes and then said goodbye.
When they were finished trick or treating, Mr. Dempsey suggested that they walk to a nearby restaurant, Shake Shake Shake, for some fries. Chloe agreed and together they walked to the restaurant, arriving at 8:45pm. When they arrived at the restaurant, Mr. Dempsey ordered the fries and gave Chloe a piece of paper to color on as they waited. At 8:50pm, the supervisor told Mr. Dempsey that there were ten minutes left in the visit. Mr. Dempsey explained to Chloe that they would need to take the fries with them. When the fries arrived, Mr. Dempsey helped Chloe gather her things. Mr. Dempsey then directed Chloe outside and together they began walking back toward Cosmonaut Coffee. Chloe told Mr. Dempsey that she was glad she was able to go trick or treating with him. Mr. Dempsey told Chloe that he, too, was glad that he was able to go trick or treating with her. Mr. Dempsey handed Chloe several fries as they walked.
When they arrived on I Street, the supervisor saw the grandmother waiting across the street and instructed Chloe to say goodbye. Mr. Dempsey helped Chloe gather her things and then gave her a hug. Chloe told Mr. Dempsey that she missed him and Mr. Dempsey told Chloe he missed her too, reminding Chloe that he would see her in the morning. Chloe said goodbye to Mr. Dempsey and walked with the supervisor across the street. Chloe told the supervisor that
she was glad that the visit did not have to end early. The supervisor helped Chloe cross the street

Brief Outline of Visitation


This report is in reference to the supervised visitation between John Dempsey and Chloe

Murphy. The visit took place at Cosmonaut Coffee, located in Tacoma, Washington.


The supervisor arrived at 4:58pm and met Chloe and the grandmother on the corner of Division and N.  I Street. Chloe greeted the supervisor with a smile and handed her a bar of chocolate, telling the supervisor that she had brought one bar for Mr. Dempsey and one bar for the supervisor. Chloe appeared to be very excited about her offering, telling the supervisor about the chocolates she had picked out. The supervisor decided to carry the chocolate bar with her
and wait until the end of the visit to return the chocolate bar to the grandmother, so as not to hurt Chloe’s feelings. The supervisor confirmed the end time with the grandmother and then walked with Chloe across the street to Cosmonaut Coffee. Chloe spotted Mr. Dempsey in the window and waved at him before entering the coffee shop. Once inside, Mr. Dempsey greeted Chloe with a hug and Chloe handed him a chocolate bar. Mr. Dempsey thanked Chloe, and then pointed to the barista and asked Chloe if she remembered Erika. Chloe ran to the barista and gave her a hug.  The barista commented on how big Chloe had gotten and asked Chloe if she remembered spending time with her when she was younger. Chloe told the barista she did, and together they talked about school and what she was learning. Chloe told the barista that she knew multiplication and that Mr. Dempsey had taught her.
 
When Chloe was finished talking to the barista, she sat down with Mr. Dempsey on a bar stool near the window and asked him for a piece of paper. Mr. Dempsey handed Chloe a piece
of paper from his bag and Chloe began to practice multiplication as they sat together. Mr. Dempsey handed Chloe a light-up bracelet and an action figure. Chloe asked Mr. Dempsey if they could go trick or treating together, and requested that Mr. Dempsey ask for a three-hour visit next time. Mr. Dempsey told Chloe he would see what he could do. Chloe asked Mr. Dempsey if she could get something to drink. Mr. Dempsey suggested that they eat food first, and then return to the coffee shop later for a hot chocolate. Chloe agreed and asked Mr. Dempsey what else he had brought with him. Mr. Dempsey reached into his bag and handed
Chloe a Ranger Rick magazine. Together they looked through the Ranger Rick magazine. After several minutes, Chloe told Mr. Dempsey that she needed to use the restroom. Mr. Dempsey pointed to the restroom and reminded Chloe to wash her hands when she was finished. When Chloe returned from the restroom, Mr. Dempsey handed her a small laser pointer. Chloe jumped up and down with excitement and asked Mr. Dempsey about the laser as she pointed it around
the coffee shop. Mr. Dempsey reminded Chloe to use care when operating the laser, instructing her not to shine the laser at people or animals. Mr. Dempsey then told Chloe that he had made plans for them to carve pumpkins during their Sunday visit. Chloe appeared excited, and together they talked in anticipation about Sunday’s visit. When they were finished, Mr. Dempsey directed Chloe outside and suggested that they take the laser across the street to the park to see how far it would shine. Chloe agreed, and held Mr. Dempsey’s hand as they walked across the street to Wright Park.

When they arrived at the park, Chloe and Mr. Dempsey walked along a graveled trail and stopped several times to shine the laser at different objects in the park. As they walked, Chloe attempted, several times, to hang on Mr. Dempsey’s arms. Each time, Mr. Dempsey redirected Chloe, asking her to ‘please walk’. After several attempts, Chloe asked Mr. Dempsey why. Mr. Dempsey told Chloe that it made his arms feel heavy and would cause him to sink to the ground. Chloe appeared satisfied with his answer and then continued to walk next to Mr. Dempsey.
When they reached the playground, Chloe asked Mr. Dempsey if they could play the ‘monster’ game. Mr. Dempsey agreed and began to make monster noises, following Chloe to the playground. Mr. Dempsey engaged with Chloe, chasing her around the playground as Chloe
 
instructed him where to go. When Chloe was finished playing the ‘monster’ game, Mr. Dempsey suggested they look for the cannon. Chloe agreed and ran ahead in the grass. Mr. Dempsey followed Chloe to the cannon and together they stopped to talk about the cannon. Chloe climbed on top of the cannon and asked Mr. Dempsey to pretend with her. Mr. Dempsey pretended to light the cannon and after several minutes, Chloe directed Mr. Dempsey back
toward the grass to continue playing the ‘monster’ game. Mr. Dempsey chased Chloe around the grass and then stopped with her to look at mushroom.

When they were finished playing, Chloe asked Mr. Dempsey if they could return to Cosmonaut for a hot chocolate. Mr. Dempsey suggested they go to Subway first for a sandwich. Chloe agreed, and together they walked back toward Division and across the street to Subway. Mr. Dempsey talked with Chloe about his memories of Chloe’s mother and the time they had spent together at Subway and Cosmonaut. When they arrived at Subway, Mr. Dempsey asked Chloe what kind of sandwich she wanted. Mr. Dempsey ordered a foot-long ham sandwich, a bag of cheddar sour cream chips and a drink to share. Mr. Dempsey directed Chloe to a booth near the window and sat down. Chloe sat next to Mr. Dempsey and the supervisor sat across from them. While they were eating, Mr. Dempsey’s phone rang. Mr. Dempsey appeared shocked that he was receiving a call and commented that he wondered if something was wrong. Mr. Dempsey noted that it was his mother calling, answered the phone, and put it on speaker. When everything seemed fine, Mr. Dempsey asked Chloe to tell his mother the number of pumpkins she wanted for Sunday’s visit. Chloe told Mr. Dempsey how many pumpkins she wanted and Mr. Dempsey communicated the number to his mother, told her he would call her back at another time to confirm the visit time, and then ended the call and put his phone away. Chloe finished her sandwich and together she and Mr. Dempsey talked about school. Mr. Dempsey praised Chloe for earning a ‘4’ and showed excitement for her accomplishments in
class. Mr. Dempsey then told Chloe that he recently had a business review at work that had gone well. Chloe asked Mr. Dempsey how much money he was making at his new job. Mr. Dempsey paused, and then told Chloe that he had made $10,000.00 since starting his new job, explaining that he was doing very well.

chocolate before walking back to the park. Mr. Dempsey offered the supervisor a piece of chocolate. The supervisor declined, and Chloe explained that she had also given the supervisor a bar of chocolate.

When they were finished eating, Mr. Dempsey walked with Chloe back to the park where they spent the remainder of the visit. Chloe asked Mr. Dempsey to pretend as if they were
having a laser light show. Chloe shone the laser around the park and together she and Mr. Dempsey tossed the light-up bracelet back and forth in the air. At 6:45pm, Chloe led Mr. Dempsey back into the park, toward the pond. Chloe and Mr. Dempsey walked around the pond together. At 6:50pm, the supervisor reminded Mr. Dempsey that there were ten minutes left in the visit. Mr. Dempsey did not acknowledge the supervisor, so she repeated herself, and then gave a five-minute warning at 6:55pm. At the five-minute warning, Mr. Dempsey directed
Chloe back toward Cosmonaut Coffee. When they were approaching the edge of the park, the supervisor noticed that the grandmother had arrived and suggested Chloe say goodbye to Mr. Dempsey in the park. Chloe gave Mr. Dempsey a hug and asked for another piece of chocolate. Mr. Dempsey gave her another piece of chocolate and told Chloe he loved her and would see her on Sunday.

Chloe walked with the supervisor to the edge of the park and met the grandmother at

7:00pm. The supervisor asked the grandmother if she could speak with her privately. The grandmother agreed and the supervisor explained to the grandmother that she was not allowed to accept gifts but did not want to hurt Chloe’s feelings.

Dempsey was still inside the park. The supervisor said goodbye to Chloe and left the area.

Brief Outline of Visitation

This report is in reference to the supervised visitation between John Dempsey and a child, Chloe Murphy. John Dempsey is fic of kin not a biological family member to this child. Therefore, John Dempsey will be referred to as Mr. Dempsey or John throughout this report. I met Chloe and Maternal Grandmother on the sidewalk outside Corina Bakery. Chloe gave Maternal Grandmother hugs and kisses goodbye. Chloe and I walked inside the bakery and met Mr. Dempsey. Mr. Dempsey wore a hat for a costume and Chloe was dressed as a princess. Chloe and Mr. Dempsey were talking about her costume when Maternal Grandmother got my attention through the bakery window. She motioned with a camera in hand. Chloe and I stepped outside the door and Maternal Grandmother gave Chloe her camera. Chloe had wanted to bring her camera to the visit. Chloe and I reentered the bakery. Mr. Dempsey gave Chloe a few
options for activities, as the ballet would not start for an hour. Chloe chose to eat a croissant and visit the bicycle shop first. While eating her croissant, Chloe and Mr. Dempsey conversed about past ballets, they had watched.
After she finished the croissant, we walked down the street to the bicycle shop. On the way, Chloe identified her past home and window. Mr. Dempsey said someone else lives there now, Chloe asked if he knew whom. Mr. Dempsey said no. Chloe and Mr. Dempsey conversed about Mr. Dempsey buying a new bicycle, lights, and gadgets for Chloe’s bicycle. After leaving the bicycle shop, we made our way to the thrift shop a few blocks away. Chloe and Mr.
 
Dempsey tried on scarfs and looked at several items. They began to play with plastic swords. Mr. Dempsey suggested they purchase the swords and play with them outside. After purchasing the swords, Chloe and Mr. Dempsey played sword fighting in the parking lot until it was time to attend the ballet.
We walked down the block to the ballet and entered. Mr. Dempsey purchased tickets and they had their fortunes read. We soon began our tour and then entered the theatre where Chloe and Mr. Dempsey sat on the floor. During the ballet Mr. Dempsey and Chloe conversed about
the costumes and dancing. Toward the end of the performance, Chloe lie on the floor and leaned her head on Mr. Dempsey’s knee. He was sitting cross-legged on the floor with both hands visible. Chloe then moved her head onto Mr. Dempsey’s leg. I had given Mr. Dempsey time to redirect Chloe’s physical contact with him. I then approached Mr. Dempsey and told him that Chloe needed to either sit up or lean against his shoulder. Mr. Dempsey immediately told Chloe to sit up. Chloe sat up and then lay on the floor with her head on his coat. There were no further incidents of any nature during the rest of the visit.
After the performance Mr. Dempsey, Chloe and I made our way out of the building and back to the bakery. Chloe ate another croissant and had lemon water. Chloe watched a children’s movie on Mr. Dempsey’s IPad. Chloe asked for another croissant. Mr. Dempsey said no, one was enough but he would share his breakfast croissant with her. Chloe said she did not like breakfast croissants. Chloe and Mr. Dempsey then decided to walk to the Cosmonaut Café.
We walked through Wrights Park and to the Café. On the way to the Café, Chloe and

Mr. Dempsey played sword fighting. Mr. Dempsey asked Chloe on a few occasions not to hit so hard with the swords. Chloe hit Mr. Dempsey and he told her to stop. Chloe asked Mr.
Dempsey if they could look for plant they had planted together on Earth day. They walked to an area and looked for the plant. We arrived at the Café and Mr. Dempsey purchased refreshments for them. Chloe and Mr. Dempsey at and watched a children’s program while they drank their refreshments. Mr. Dempsey said he would set an alarm to notify him when it was time to return to the bakery to end the visit. Mr. Dempsey then told Chloe it was time to make their way back to the bakery.
As we walked through the park, Chloe and Mr. Dempsey began sword fighting again. As we made our way past the cannon display, Chloe climbed on top the cannon and she and Mr. Dempsey played make believe. During their play, Chloe said I want you to pack the cannon full
 
of powder so I can go all the way to Hawaii. Mr. Dempsey pretended to pack the cannon. As they pretended to fly to Hawaii, Chloe said oh no we forgot Grandma. Mr. Dempsey said oh no let’s go back and get her. So they pretended to fly back and pick up grandma and Richard.
After playing on the cannon, we made our way back to the bakery. Mr. Dempsey and Chloe conversed for a few minutes and looked to see if there was a children’s night at the theatre. After a few minutes, Chloe started to walk off toward where we were to meet Maternal
Grandmother. Mr. Dempsey asked where she was going they still had a few minutes left. Chloe came back and they conversed about the next visit at his mother’s house. When it was time to leave, Chloe and Mr. Dempsey hugged and said goodbye. Chloe and I walked around the corner and met Maternal Grandmother.
Endnotes Regarding Supervisor's Redirection: I did not end the visit when I told Mr. Dempsey to redirect Chloe's physical contact for two reasons; Mr. Dempsey immediately resolved the issue when asked without hesitation or comment, and I felt it would have been detrimental to Chloe to abruptly end the visit in the middle of the ballet.

mother. Chloe and Mr. Dempsey looked at the exhibits and conversed about the different objects and places in the exhibits. Chloe boarded a covered wagon and asked Mr. Dempsey to climb aboard. Mr. Dempsey and Chloe played make believe on the covered wagon. Chloe then went
 
to an exhibit and started pushing the audio button when it did not come on Chloe said...ya bastards. She then walked back to the covered wagon. Mr. Dempsey and Chloe completed the Scavenger Hunt and retrieved her prize at the front counter. While walking through the exhibits Mr. Dempsey motioned to Chloe’s arm and asked her what was wrong with her arm. Chloe looked at her arm; there was a small nickel size bruise on the inside of her upper arm. Chloe said it was nothing it happened a few days ago.
We left the museum and Mr. Dempsey asked Chloe if she was hungry. Chloe said she would like Pho. We made our way to the Pho restaurant. Once we entered, we discovered they were closing. Mr. Dempsey mentioned Jimmy John’s sandwich shop. Chloe decided she was no longer hungry. Mr. Dempsey asked if she had dinner. After several minutes, Chloe finally said no. Mr. Dempsey said they were going to get a sandwich. We entered the sandwich shop and Mr. Dempsey ordered a sandwich and drink. Chloe refused to eat and began to squirm in her seat.  Mr. Dempsey told Chloe to sit up and sit appropriately at the table. Mr. Dempsey ate part of the sandwich and asked Chloe several times if she would like to share the sandwich. Chloe
finally ate a portion of the sandwich. Chloe told Mr. Dempsey she did not want him to watch her eat. Mr. Dempsey said he would not watch her eat.
As we left the sandwich shop, the trolley was leaving the stop across the street. We made our way across the street to the trolley stop and waited. At 7:10 pm I text our office after hours number and notified the office we would be a few minutes late as the trolley still was not in
sight. The trolley did not arrive until 7:15 pm. We boarded the trolley. Mr. Dempsey and Chloe talked about the ballet they would be attending on Saturday. Chloe took her shoe off and asked Mr. Dempsey to fix her shoelace. Mr. Dempsey untied her shoe and told her to put the shoe on. Chloe began to talk in baby talk and play around. Mr. Dempsey reminded Chloe we were running late to put her shoe on. Chloe put her shoe on and the trolley stopped. Mr. Dempsey
and Chloe hugged goodbye and we exited the trolley at 7:19 pm.

Maternal Grandmother was waiting at the trolley stop. Maternal Grandmother said I needed to be on time and that she was worried. She said she makes sure she is on time to visits. I apologized and agreed we need to be on time. I explained that the trolley arrived late to the location. I told her I had texted our office after hours number and asked if she had her phone. She said her phone was at home on the counter. I again apologized and agreed we should have been on time.  End of Report

Brief Outline of Visitation


This report is in reference to the supervised visitation between John Dempsey and Chloe

Murphy. The visit took place at 4222 Memory Lane West in University Place, Washington.


The supervisor arrived at 12:00pm and greeted the grandmother in the driveway. The grandmother asked about the end time of the visit, and questioned the supervisor as to who was supervising. The supervisor confirmed the end time of the visit, and told the grandmother the information had been sent to her in the confirmation email. Chloe was wearing a t-shirt, long pants, and a sweater. The supervisor walked with Chloe to the entrance of the residence and waited for Mr. Dempsey, who arrived with Howard at 12:07pm.1 Mr. Dempsey greeted Chloe and Chloe gave Mr. Dempsey a piece of artwork she had created for him. Mr. Dempsey thanked Chloe and directed her into the house. Once inside the house, Chloe asked Mr. Dempsey what
he had brought for the visit. Mr. Dempsey opened a box of small toys and set them on the table. Chloe found a laser beam and began playing with it, pointing it on the ceiling. Chloe, Mr. Dempsey and Howard discussed the laser beam and took turns suggesting different laser tips (removable pieces that changed the laser design) to try. As Chloe played with the laser beam,
Mr. Dempsey went into the kitchen and began cooking edamame.



1 Mr. Dempsey called CFS at 12pm to inform them that he would be a few minutes late.
 
When Chloe was done playing with the laser beam, she suggested they play ‘the marble game’. Chloe hid a marble in the room and Mr. Dempsey attempted to locate the marble. After several minutes, Chloe returned to the kitchen to play with the laser beam. When the edamame was finished cooking, Chloe asked Mr. Dempsey if they could play ‘the restaurant game’. Mr. Dempsey agreed, and pretended to be a restaurant server as Chloe sat at the kitchen counter. Together they ate the edamame. While they were eating the edamame, Mr. Dempsey asked Chloe if she knew what an anarchist was. Chloe did not, and Mr. Dempsey asked her to take a guess. Chloe asked if anarchists were people who told jokes. Mr. Dempsey and Howard
laughed and Mr. Dempsey told Chloe that anarchists needed to be able to laugh, and have a sense of humor. Mr. Dempsey told Chloe that anarchists are people who don’t like rules, and then explained that the opposite of an anarchist were those who liked rules, and wanted more of them. Howard then said, ‘Yeah, we don’t like them’, and together Howard and Mr. Dempsey laughed. Mr. Dempsey did not use the word anarchist in the context of the case or in regards to the supervisor; however, it appeared that Mr. Dempsey and Howard were having an exchange that suggested the word had more meaning to them than to Chloe. The supervisor did not intervene because often Mr. Dempsey will use new words, teaching Chloe the meaning of them. Chloe continued to eat, and then asked Mr. Dempsey about a model sailboat in the dining room.

Chloe got up and went to the model sailboat, asking Mr. Dempsey about the boat. Mr. Dempsey and Howard told Chloe about the model sailboat, and together they talked about sailboats. When Chloe was finished with the edamame, she directed Mr. Dempsey into the
living room, where they looked outside at the beach. Chloe told Mr. Dempsey that she wanted to go to the beach. Mr. Dempsey agreed, stating that it looked like the rain had stopped. Howard reminded Chloe that she needed to stay dry, and suggested that if they went to the beach, they take an alternate route that would prevent Chloe from slipping and getting wet. Mr. Dempsey agreed, and then Howard suggested they walk to a nearby park. Chloe told Mr. Dempsey that
she really wanted to go to the beach. Together Mr. Dempsey and Howard talked with Chloe about her options and what would be best, given the weather and her safety. As they discussed, Chloe and Mr. Dempsey decided to continue playing ‘the marble game’. Chloe hid the marble around the living room and instructed Mr. Dempsey to find it. Each time the marble was hidden, Mr. Dempsey stopped to asked Chloe if the marble was anywhere near her.  If Chloe said yes,
 
Mr. Dempsey instructed Chloe to move to another side of the room so he could look. When they were finished playing, Chloe told Mr. Dempsey that her favorite part of the visits was being able to spend time with Mr. Dempsey. Mr. Dempsey thanked Chloe and Chloe gave Mr. Dempsey a hug. Chloe then asked if they could go to the beach, and Mr. Dempsey agreed. Chloe put on her shoes and walked with Mr. Dempsey outside, where Howard directed them toward a path that would be safe.

Chloe, Mr. Dempsey, and Howard walked down the path to the beach. Several times, Mr. Dempsey reminded Chloe to walk slowly and use the handrail to keep from falling. When they reached the train tracks, Mr. Dempsey asked Chloe, ‘Do you hear a train? Do you see a train?’ to which Chloe answered no. After looking both ways, they proceeded safely to the beach. When they reached the beach, Howard reminded Chloe to stay dry. Chloe walked with Mr. Dempsey and Howard on the beach and began to explore. Howard showed Chloe a small tide pool and picked up a clam for Chloe to look at. Chloe then directed Mr. Dempsey to a section of sand and told Mr. Dempsey that she wanted to build a house like they did on their last visit at the beach. Mr. Dempsey agreed and began shoveling the sand into a pile as Chloe collected various shells to decorate the ‘house’. Howard helped Chloe look for shells. When Mr. Dempsey was finished shoveling the pile, Chloe took the shovel and began to dig near a small stream. Howard reminded Chloe not to get wet and then left the beach area. Chloe continued to dig and explore on the beach. Mr. Dempsey sat on a log and watched as Chloe played, engaging with her when she returned to add items to the ‘house’. Chloe and Mr. Dempsey talked about different animals and played together in the sand. At 2:00pm, Howard returned to the beach and asked if they were ready to go to the park. Chloe asked Mr. Dempsey if she could point the laser beam at the beach, first. Mr. Dempsey handed Chloe the laser beam and Chloe carried the laser beam with her as they began to walk toward the park.

As they walked to the park, Chloe played with the laser beam and then asked Mr. Dempsey for a snack. Mr. Dempsey gave Chloe a squeezable fruit snack and together they walked with Howard to the park. When they arrived at the park, Chloe and Mr. Dempsey played on the playground together. Mr. Dempsey followed Chloe and encouraged her as she played. Chloe then asked Mr. Dempsey to pretend like he was a monster and that he needed to try to catch her. Chloe and Mr. Dempsey ran around the playground together and Chloe told Mr.
 
Dempsey where to go and what to say, as he pretended to be a monster. Howard watched them as they played. At one point, Chloe told Mr. Dempsey that she needed to use the restroom. Mr. Dempsey directed her to a bathroom nearby and told her he would wait until she was finished and then he, too, would use the restroom. When Chloe was in the restroom, the supervisor overheard Mr. Dempsey and Howard talking about the design of the park. Howard explained to Mr. Dempsey that children had designed the park. Mr. Dempsey asked Howard about this, saying that the children designed it and then lawyers probably came and changed it, for liability reasons. Howard agreed this was probably the case. Mr. Dempsey then told Howard that he could get sued for what he writes. Howard asked Mr. Dempsey what he meant, asking if he was referring to his job. Mr. Dempsey agreed, stating that if he writes something that’s not true at
work, he could get sued. Howard told Mr. Dempsey that, ‘sure’, and ‘this is probably true for all companies’. Mr. Dempsey agreed and then explained that across the country, anyone can get sued for writing false statements. They discussed this together until Chloe returned from the restroom. Mr. Dempsey then went to into the bathroom and Chloe waited with Howard on the playground until he returned. When Mr. Dempsey returned from the restroom, Chloe and Mr. Dempsey continued to play ‘monster’ on the playground. When Chloe was finished playing monster, they found a sandbox and Chloe played in the sand.

At 3:35pm, Howard told Mr. Dempsey the time, and together they gathered their things and began to walk back toward the house. On the way, Chloe stopped to empty the sand from her shoes. Howard gave Chloe her squeezable snack, which Chloe finished as they walked. On the way back to the house, Chloe stopped and asked Mr. Dempsey to dance with her in a driveway. Mr. Dempsey danced with Chloe, holding her hands and then releasing her to dance on her own. They danced for several minutes and then the supervisor reminded Mr. Dempsey that they needed to be back at the house before the grandmother arrived. Mr. Dempsey told the supervisor that they would be fine on time, and then directed Chloe to continue walking. When they arrived at Memory Lane, Chloe stopped to look at the miniature horse and goat. Howard told Chloe he would run ahead to the house and return with some snacks to feed the animals.
The supervisor told Mr. Dempsey that they had twelve minutes left in the visit. Chloe asked Mr. Dempsey if they could have ice cream when they returned to the house. Mr. Dempsey told
Chloe that he did not think there would be enough time. Chloe then decided that she did not
 
want to feed the animals, and together she and Mr. Dempsey walked back to the house. Howard met them in the garage, and walked with them into the house. Chloe then asked Mr. Dempsey to pull out the tablet and together Chloe and Mr. Dempsey played a video game on the tablet as Howard prepared them ice cream. With five minutes left in the visit, Chloe ate the ice cream and played a video game on the tablet. At 3:58pm, the supervisor told Chloe it was time to say goodbye. Chloe put on her shoes, said goodbye to Mr. Dempsey, and walked with the supervisor to the driveway where they met the grandmother at 4:00pm.

Brief Outline of Visitation

This report is in reference to the supervised visitation between John Dempsey and a child, Chloe Murphy. John Dempsey is fic of kin not a biological family member to this child. Therefore, John Dempsey will be referred to as Mr. Dempsey or John throughout this report. I met Maternal Grandmother and Chloe at the Trolley Stop at the Theatre District. Maternal Grandmother said Chloe had tights on under her skirt, I said yes they were fine. Maternal Grandmother and Chloe said goodbye. Chloe and I began to walk away from the Trolley Stop when Chloe spotted Mr. Dempsey. Chloe yelled Daddy and started to run to him, I told Chloe to wait for me and not run ahead as Mr. Dempsey was quite far. As we approached Mr. Dempsey, Chloe said Daddy, Daddy, and they hugged. Chloe jumped up to hug Mr. Dempsey and he
caught her under her arms and put her down. Mr. Dempsey asked Chloe what she would like to do and said he knew of a soup place he wanted to take her. Chloe asked to go to the soup place and look through shops.
We boarded the trolley and Chloe told Mr. Dempsey which chair to sit in and sat in the chair next to him. Chloe said she would not sit in his lap. Mr. Dempsey said yes, smart girl.
Mr. Dempsey and Chloe talked about the signs on the trolley and the meaning of each sign. We exited the trolley and Chloe climbed up onto a statue. We entered the bookstore where Mr. Dempsey and Chloe looked at books, writing utensils, and stuffed animals. Mr. Dempsey purchased some items for Chloe. Mr. Dempsey and Chloe sat on the floor and looked through
 
and read books. After leaving the bookstore, Chloe wanted to walk through one of the buildings at the UWT campus. We walked through the building and Mr. Dempsey and Chloe talked about classrooms and the furnishings. We sat on the benches outside the building where Mr. Dempsey asked Chloe if she was hungry and if she wanted PHO. Chloe said sure, and they talked about her not gaining any weight. Chloe said Maternal Grandmother wanted her to gain weight. Mr. Dempsey said some people are just small. Mr. Dempsey asked if she has been eating. Chloe said yes. They talked about her food likes and dislikes.
On our way to the PHO restaurant Chloe stopped and asked Mr. Dempsey why he did not come back after that week. Chloe said the Maternal Grandmother said Mr. Dempsey did not return because he thought it would be too hard to take care of her. Mr. Dempsey said that is not true, I never said that. Mr. Dempsey said he loves her very much and misses her. Chloe then asked about future living arrangements and Mr. Dempsey said he sees her as much as he can
right now and she is his favorite person. Mr. Dempsey asked if that answer would suffice for now, Chloe said yes.
Chloe and Mr. Dempsey shared Pho together. Mr. Dempsey and Chloe talked about trips and things they did when she was younger. Chloe began to eat her noodles off her plate with her mouth and no utensils. Mr. Dempsey handed her some napkins and asked her to clean herself
up. When Chloe began to repeat the behavior, Mr. Dempsey told Chloe to act 7 years old and she was not using her manners. They continued to talk and then we left the Pho restaurant.
As we were walking to the trolley stop, Chloe asked Mr. Dempsey if she could jump on his back. Mr. Dempsey said not at this time. Chloe said okay. We entered the trolley and rode back to Theatre District stop. During our trolley ride, Chloe asked Mr. Dempsey to say hi to her grandma. Mr. Dempsey said she would probably see his mother again.

Brief Outline of Visitation


This report is in reference to the supervised visitation between John Dempsey and Chloe

Murphy. The visit took place at 4222 Memory Lane West in University Place, Washington.


The grandmother arrived at 1:52pm and greeted the supervisor in the driveway. The grandmother invited the supervisor to inspect Chloe’s clothing and instructed Chloe to bend over to ensure her clothing was appropriate. Chloe was dressed in pants, a t-shirt, and a long sleeve jacket. The grandmother reminded Chloe that she was not to play in the water during the visit, and then said goodbye to Chloe. The supervisor followed Chloe to the entrance of the residence, and then around the house, where she met Mr. Dempsey on the patio. Mr. Dempsey greeted Chloe and said hello to the supervisor. Chloe told Mr. Dempsey that she was not allowed to play in the water during the visit. Chloe then led Mr. Dempsey into the house where she found a box full of items Mr. Dempsey had brought for the visit. Some of the items in the box included several varieties of snacks, a set of pipe cleaners, several small toys, a VA card of Chloe’s mother, and several other small items. Next to the box was a scale. Chloe and Mr. Dempsey sat at the table and together they talked about the different items and took turns weighing the items on the scale. As they were weighing the items, Howard appeared and greeted Chloe. Howard then introduced himself to the supervisor and watched as Chloe engaged with Mr. Dempsey at
the table.
 
After weighing several items, Chloe pulled out a notebook. Chloe and Mr. Dempsey talked about the story they had created and Mr. Dempsey suggested that they continue writing their story together. Chloe agreed, and began telling Mr. Dempsey what to write. Chloe then asked Mr. Dempsey for a knife to cut a banana. Mr. Dempsey told Chloe he would cut the banana for her, and then went outside to the patio to cut the banana. When they were finished eating the banana, Chloe directed Mr. Dempsey back inside and suggested they play ‘owls’ in the living room. Mr. Dempsey agreed and followed Chloe into the living room, where she took off her shoes. Chloe and Mr. Dempsey played ‘owls’ in the living room, pretending to fly back and forth between the couches. Chloe told Mr. Dempsey where to ‘fly’ and what to pretend to do as an owl. Together they played, stopping several times to look out the window at the water.
As they played, Chloe tried several times to climb onto Mr. Dempsey.1  The supervisor

intervened each time, instructing Chloe to stay on the ground, or to sit next to Mr. Dempsey, rather than on top of him. When they were done playing ‘owls’, Chloe asked if they could have a snack. Mr. Dempsey agreed and Chloe went into the kitchen and then returned with two fruit snacks. Chloe and Mr. Dempsey ate the fruit snacks and then they decided to go downstairs to see what Howard was doing.

Mr. Dempsey followed Chloe down the stairs and together they stopped at the bottom to look at a display of shells. Mr. Dempsey kneeled down next to Chloe and together they talked about the shells. When they were finished, they found Howard watching a soccer game and went to a nearby window to look at a sunflower in the yard. Chloe told Mr. Dempsey she wanted to wash her hands. Mr. Dempsey directed Chloe to a bathroom downstairs where she washed her hands. When she was finished, they walked back upstairs and decided to look in the refrigerator for food. Mr. Dempsey held Chloe’s hand and together they looked, before walking to a nearby piano. Chloe and Mr. Dempsey played several notes and then Mr. Dempsey opened a ukulele case, handing Chloe a ukulele. Chloe spent several minutes playing the ukulele and then told
Mr. Dempsey she was hungry. Chloe asked if they could play restaurant and Mr. Dempsey agreed. Chloe sat down at the kitchen counter and Mr. Dempsey stood in the kitchen, pretending to be a restaurant owner. Mr. Dempsey offered Chloe a choice of edamame or fried rice. Chloe
decided on edamame and sat at the counter, playing with pipe cleaners, as Mr. Dempsey



1 It is Mr. Dempsey's responsibility to instruct Chloe not to climb on him.
 
prepared the edamame. As the edamame cooked, Chloe decided to play ‘store’ with Mr. Dempsey and together they sat at the table as Chloe pretended to sell Mr. Dempsey the different items on the table. When the edamame was done, they ate at the table and then returned to the living room to play ‘flying dragons’. Together Chloe and Mr. Dempsey played ‘flying dragons’ in the living room. Chloe ‘flew’ between couches and told Mr. Dempsey where to ‘fly’. As they played, they stopped to look out the window. Several times, Chloe lay on the floor and asked
Mr. Dempsey to pick her up with his ‘talons’. Mr. Dempsey held Chloe’s hands with one hand and put his arm under her knees with the other, carrying her to the couch a couple feet away, each time. They continued to pretend to ‘fly’ around the room until Chloe noticed that Mr.
Dempsey had a long hair on his eyebrow. Mr. Dempsey looked at himself in a nearby mirror and then together they walked downstairs to look in a different mirror. After looking in the second mirror, Mr. Dempsey laid down on the floor. As soon as Mr. Dempsey lay down, Chloe walked over and attempted to lie down on top of him.2  The supervisor immediately intervened and told Chloe that she needed to stay off Mr. Dempsey. Chloe stood up and then directed Mr. Dempsey back upstairs to continue playing.

They played ‘flying dragons’ for several minutes and then began to stretch out on the floor as they played. At one point, Mr. Dempsey sat down on the floor with his legs apart. When Mr. Dempsey sat down, Chloe walked over to him and sat down facing him, placing one foot on each of Mr. Dempsey’s thighs, and hoisting herself toward him. 3 The supervisor intervened and told Chloe that she needed to stay on the floor. Mr. Dempsey redirected Chloe,
stood up, and then told Chloe: ‘she’s concerned about something’.4  Mr. Dempsey suggested that

they walk down to the beach. Chloe agreed, and together they walked into the kitchen to put on their shoes. As they put on their shoes, Chloe said to Mr. Dempsey, ‘I can’t wait until we can live together again’, to which Mr. Dempsey replied: ‘Me too, someday we will live together in the same house’.5  The supervisor intervened and said, ‘We cannot talk about that. We don’t know what will happen’, to which Mr. Dempsey replied, ‘That’s right, we don’t know’. Chloe
then said, ‘But when I’m 18 I can choose’. Mr. Dempsey then said, ‘You’re right; adults have

the freedom to make their own decisions’.6  The supervisor repeated herself, and then Mr. Dempsey directed Chloe outside and down the hill to the beach.


When they arrived at the end of the hill, Mr. Dempsey asked Chloe to wait before crossing the train tracks. When it was safe, Mr. Dempsey directed Chloe to the beach entrance and reminded her that she was not allowed to get wet during the visit. Chloe agreed, and walked onto the beach, toward the water’s edge. The supervisor reminded Chloe that she was not allowed to play in the water during the visit. Chloe sat down in the sand and began building a
‘house’ near the water’s edge. Chloe and Mr. Dempsey talked about the ‘house’ and together they constructed a small wall of sand near the water’s edge. They talked back and forth about building the ‘house’ and when Mr. Dempsey stopped building, Chloe instructed him to continue by making his own. The supervisor then heard Mr. Dempsey say under his breath, ‘I’ll make a
house, that’s why I’m visiting so much. I’ll get you back’.7  Chloe did not acknowledge Mr.

Dempsey’s statement and again told him to build a ‘house’ in the sand. Chloe and Mr. Dempsey sat together in the sand and talked about the wall they were building. As they played in the sand, the tide began to rise and water started to hit the side of the sand ‘house’. The supervisor reminded Chloe that she was not to get wet, and that she needed to keep her clothes dry. Mr. Dempsey helped Chloe add sand to the wall in order to prevent the water from coming over the edge. At one point, Chloe positioned two seashells on the sand and told Mr. Dempsey that they looked like ‘boobs’. Mr. Dempsey told Chloe that they were seashells. Chloe and Mr. Dempsey sang together as they played in the sand, and Mr. Dempsey asked her about the museums they had been to in past visits.

When the water continued to rise, the supervisor noted that the sand was beginning to turn to mud. The supervisor told Chloe that the sand was becoming wet and that she needed to be careful not to get her clothing wet. After several reminders, Mr. Dempsey directed Chloe toward the dock, away from the sand.8  Chloe found a long piece of seaweed and then walked onto the dock as Mr. Dempsey gathered their things. Chloe and Mr. Dempsey played with the
seaweed on the dock, and after several minutes, Howard arrived and sat down on the deck to

8 This visit was scheduled with the understanding that Chloe would not get wet. It was Mr. Dempsey's responsibility to see that this condition was followed.
 
watch. Mr. Dempsey played with Chloe and then sat down next to Howard. Chloe played with the seaweed and then attempted to sit on Mr. Dempsey’s lap. Mr. Dempsey directed Chloe to sit on the armrest of the chair, where she sat for several minutes before returning to the seaweed. When Chloe was finished playing, she told Mr. Dempsey that she wanted to return to the house. Mr. Dempsey agreed, and together they walked back to the house with Howard. On the way,
Mr. Dempsey told Chloe that he had spoken with Michelle from Camp Sparkle on the internet. Chloe listened and then together they talked about Camp Sparkle until they arrived at the house.

When they arrived at the house, Howard asked Chloe to wait outside until he retrieved a towel for her to wipe her feet. Chloe and Mr. Dempsey sat outside and when Howard returned with a towel, Chloe sat down to wipe her feet. Mr. Dempsey opened an orange and offered Chloe a piece. Chloe declined the orange and asked Mr. Dempsey if she could have some Pocky. Mr. Dempsey agreed, and together they sat on the patio and ate Pocky together. When they were finished, Mr. Dempsey gave Chloe a hug and told her he loved her. Mr. Dempsey then directed Chloe into the house and asked if she wanted something to eat. Chloe told Mr.
Dempsey that she wanted more edamame. Mr. Dempsey offered Chloe a glass of water and then began to prepare the edamame. While the edamame was cooking, Chloe, Mr. Dempsey, and Howard played with the pipe cleaners and several stringed instruments of Howard’s. Chloe and Mr. Dempsey ate the edamame at the table and then Chloe told Mr. Dempsey she needed to use the restroom.

While Chloe was in the restroom, Mr. Dempsey turned to the supervisor and asked several times: ‘How many ‘I love yous’ did you get?’, ‘How many daddys?’. The supervisor explained that she was observing their interactions but would not discuss it with him. Mr. Dempsey then told the supervisor: ‘Nobody knows who I am’. Mr. Dempsey then changed his tone and raised his arms, saying, ‘Who are you?’ and ‘We’re going to smear you’, before turning back to the supervisor and saying: ‘There are so many disputes going on’. The supervisor interrupted Mr. Dempsey and said, ‘I cannot talk to you about this’ and ‘You need to stop’. Mr. Dempsey responded by saying: ‘Oh, you can’t? What can you talk about?’ to which the supervisor replied: ‘I cannot talk to you about things related to the case’. Mr. Dempsey then asked the supervisor, ‘Where did you grow up?’ The supervisor told Mr. Dempsey that she
could not talk to him about personal information. Mr. Dempsey then asked, ‘Can you tell me
 
your favorite band?’ The supervisor told Mr. Dempsey no, and then Mr. Dempsey made a statement about the weather and said, ‘Ha!’ laughing to himself.9  Neither Howard nor Chloe were present during this exchange.


When Howard returned, Mr. Dempsey made conversation with Howard, unrelated to the case. When Chloe returned from the restroom, Mr. Dempsey gave her a hug and told her he loved her. Howard asked Chloe if she wanted to feed Millie and Nicholas. Chloe showed excitement, and Howard gathered several times from the kitchen. Mr. Dempsey then got up to use the restroom and when he was finished, Howard directed them to the driveway and up the road to the fence where they were met by a goat and miniature horse. Chloe and Howard fed the animals several items through the fence as Mr. Dempsey watched. When they were finished, Chloe, Mr. Dempsey, and Howard walked back to the house. Chloe asked Mr. Dempsey how much time was left in the visit and asked if she could use Mr. Dempsey’s tablet. Mr. Dempsey asked Chloe to wait for five minutes. For five minutes, Chloe and Mr. Dempsey played ‘I Spy’ in the living room. At one point, Chloe attempted to sit on Mr. Dempsey’s lap. Mr. Dempsey immediately stood up, and Chloe began to hang from his side. The supervisor intervened and told Chloe that she needed to stay on the ground. Chloe told the supervisor: ‘I’m not on his lap’ and Mr. Dempsey released Chloe from his side, setting her on the ground. At 5:30pm, Mr. Dempsey set up the tablet up on the table. Chloe sat at the table and played a video game on the tablet. Mr. Dempsey stood next to her and engaged with her as she played. Howard offered Chloe and Mr. Dempsey each a bowl of ice cream and then sat down at the table across from Chloe.

At 5:50pm, the supervisor told Mr. Dempsey that there were ten minutes remaining in the visit. Mr. Dempsey asked Chloe if she would be interested in getting burgers during their next visit, and then helped Chloe gather her things. Mr. Dempsey told Chloe that she could take
home the ukulele, and Chloe agreed. At 5:58pm, the supervisor told Chloe to say goodbye. Chloe hugged Mr. Dempsey and told him she loved him. Chloe then said goodbye to Howard
and walked with the supervisor to the driveway where they met the grandmother at 6:00pm.




9 Mr. Dempsey behavior was completely inappropriate and out-of control. He verbally assaulted the supervisor, ignored her instruction to stop his behavior, and violated numerous CFS guidelines. See Addendum.
 
End of Report.


Addendum to Report by Christine Hanson:  CFS Guidelines are clear and we expect clients to follow them. Mr. Dempsey has been instructed numerous times not to allow Chloe to crawl up on him, not allow her to sit on his lap, and not allow her to lie on him. He will not be instructed again. Effective immediately, if Chloe attempts to sit or lie across any part of Mr. Dempsey's body, or have any contact that would require intervention by a supervisor, and he does not immediately redirect Chloe, the visit will be immediately terminated.

Mr. Dempsey has been instructed numerous times not to make comments concerning a change of custody or future plans to live with Chloe. He also fails to redirect Chloe when she makes comments regarding living with Mr. Dempsey in the future. He will not be instructed again. Effective immediately, if Mr. Dempsey makes a comment regarding a change in custody or plans to reside with Chloe, or any comments insinuating that he will "get her back", or if he fails to redirect Chloe should she make such comment, the visit will be immediately terminated.

CFS received numerous e-mails from Mr. Dempsey requesting that Sarah be removed from this case. He requested that if she is scheduled to supervise, that the visit be rescheduled. Mr. Dempsey analyzes Sarah's reports through his "team that reads every report". While I do not usually assume anything, based on Mr. Dempsey's behavior towards Sarah during this visit, I can only assume this was his attempt to intimidate Sarah into quitting the case.  I make this assumption after questioning every supervisor who has supervised this case, to see if Mr. Dempsey ever demonstrated a complete lack of respect and abuse towards them. Sarah is the only supervisor who has experienced Mr. Dempsey's ranting. I questioned Sarah as to why she did not terminate the visit. She indicated that she knew Mr. Dempsey wanted her off the case
and felt he was "attempting to push her buttons". She further indicated that Chloe was not present at the time. Sarah remained respectful and calm despite Mr. Dempsey's crazy making. This is the last time any of our supervisors will tolerate such behavior from Mr. Dempsey.

Effective immediately, if Mr. Dempsey harasses or is confrontational with any CFS

supervisor, the visit will be immediately terminated.

Chloe ate with Mr. Dempsey. While they were eating, Mr. Dempsey asked Chloe about her plans for the Halloween. During this conversation, Chloe and Mr. Dempsey spoke of different people (not sure of relationship of the people referred to in the conversation). Chloe asked if “Paula?” was a family member. Mr. Dempsey explained to Chloe that her family and his family have a different definition of who is family.

Mr. Dempsey said all he could do was ask if they could attend and that if her Grandmother did not allow it then he would just keep asking.
 
The conversation ended.

Mr. Dempsey allowed Chloe to choose which activity they would participate in. While playing mini golf Chloe would take extra swings or not count all of her hits.

This visit took place at Mr. Dempsey’s mother’s home. Mr. Dempsey’s mother was present during the entire visit. I met Maternal Grandmother and Chloe in front of the house. Maternal Grandmother brought Chloe’s new bicycle and helmet. Chloe and I put the bicycle in the garage and walked to the front door where we met Mr. Dempsey. Mr. Dempsey opened the door and greeted Chloe with hello and smiles. Chloe immediately began to tell Mr. Dempsey all about her new bicycle and asked him to come outside to see right away. Mr. Dempsey, Chloe, Dempsey’s mother, and I all went to the garage to view the bicycle. Mr. Dempsey and Chloe rode bicycles
in front of the house. While riding they were smiling, laughing and playing games.

Person Requesting Report: John Dempsey

Brief Outline of Visitation

This report is in reference to the supervised visitation between John Dempsey and a child, Chloe Murphy. John Dempsey is fic of kin not a biological family member to this child. Therefore, John Dempsey will be referred to as Mr. Dempsey or John throughout this report.
I met Maternal Grandmother and Chloe at Wrights Park. Chloe had brought her bicycle and helmet. A piece of the chain guard was loose around the pedal; I removed it and handed it to Maternal Grandmother. Maternal Grandmother stated this bicycle was supposed to be sold as well. As we were leaving Chloe said goodbye to Maternal Grandmother and stopped to wave to her as we walked away. Chloe and I met Mr. Dempsey at the corner on our way to the coffee shop. Mr. Dempsey and Chloe greeted with hello and a hug. Chloe explained her bicycle had a flat tire. Mr. Dempsey said that was not a problem they could possibly air the tire at the gas station across the street.
We walked to the gas station where Mr. Dempsey showed Chloe how to air up her tire. Afterward Mr. Dempsey asked Chloe what she would like to do. Chloe stated she wanted to visit the comic book store. Mr. Dempsey put Chloe’s helmet on her and adjusted it to fit properly. Chloe complained her helmet was wet on the inside, Mr. Dempsey said if she wanted
to ride her bicycle she must wear the helmet. Mr. Dempsey suggested bringing her helmet inside to stay dry when she returned home with Maternal Grandmother. Chloe rode her bicycle to the comic book store. Mr. Dempsey reiterated the rules of riding a bicycle such as stopping at
 
driveways to make sure no cars were coming, stopping at intersections, waiting for walk signal, using her breaks, and not going too far ahead. As we made our way to the comic book store, Mr. Dempsey showed Chloe a restaurant her mother enjoyed.
We arrived at the comic book store Chloe parked her bicycle outside. Chloe was concerned her bicycle would be stolen outside the store. Mr. Dempsey said it would be fine and would replace the bicycle if it were stolen. After several minutes inside the store, Mr. Dempsey brought Chloe’s bicycle inside the store and another piece fell off. Mr. Dempsey picked it up and put it in his bag. Mr. Dempsey gave Chloe a five-dollar budget. Chloe walked through the store and chose a couple of items that equaled more than five dollars. Chloe asked if she could talk to the store attendant and see if she could buy both items for five dollars. Mr. Dempsey
stated she could ask the attendant, he could only say yes or no. Chloe asked the attendant and he agreed. Chloe returned to Mr. Dempsey notifying him of the attendant’s decision. Mr. Dempsey paid for the items with a twenty-dollar bill; the store attendant mentioned that was more than five dollars. Mr. Dempsey said yes but her budget was five dollars. The items were purchased for five dollars and we left the store.
Mr. Dempsey gave Chloe her choice of activities such as Wrights Park, Stadium High School and a playground area across the street. Chloe declined all three and stated she was would like a hamburger. Mr. Dempsey agreed and we walked two blocks to a hamburger and shake restaurant. Before we entered the store, Mr. Dempsey asked Chloe who was in charge. Chloe stated him and then motioned to me saying and her. Mr. Dempsey said no I am, I will make the decisions, and if I need consult, I will ask her.
We entered the restaurant and Mr. Dempsey explained to Chloe she had to order a meal, not a snack. Mr. Dempsey and Chloe ordered and we sat at the counter. While waiting for the food to arrive, Mr. Dempsey and Chloe, colored, and looked through pictures and viewed the Ranger Rick magazine. During these activities, Chloe stated when she turns eighteen and can choose where to live she wanted to live with Mr. Dempsey. Mr. Dempsey showed Chloe pictures he had brought. The pictures were of Chloe, her mother, and Mr. Dempsey. Mr. Dempsey and Chloe spoke of the activities and locations of these pictures. Mr. Dempsey spoke with Chloe about a past vacation they took to Mexico when she was very little. Mr. Dempsey told Chloe he taught her to say certain words as a toddler. Mr. Dempsey and Chloe also worked on math problems together, spoke of school and homework. Chloe stated when she is eighteen
 
and old enough to say where she can go, she would like to visit Hawaii and Mexico with Mr. Dempsey. Chloe stated she would pay for their trip. Mr. Dempsey said he would pay for his own trip and maybe even hers too.1  Chloe asked for a few of the pictures Mr. Dempsey had multiples of and singles. Mr. Dempsey gave Chloe the pictures. Mr. Dempsey told Chloe they would have enough time to enjoy a hot cocoa at the coffee shop before the visit ended. Chloe
agreed.

As we made our way to the coffee shop, Chloe rode her bicycle. Mr. Dempsey told Chloe she could ride in a parking lot where only a few cars were parked, as there was no visible traffic.  Chloe rode through the parking lot and out the driveway without looking. There were no cars in the area in motion. Mr. Dempsey called out to Chloe but she was already in the
driveway. Chloe came back to Mr. Dempsey and stated she did not even realize that was a driveway. Mr. Dempsey praised her for coming right back off the driveway and making her way to him. Mr. Dempsey agreed that it is hard sometimes to know where the driveways and streets are located. Mr. Dempsey reiterated how important it is to watch for cars at all times.
We made our way to the coffee shop where Chloe and Mr. Dempsey shared a hot chocolate and played games on his tablet. At the end of the visit, Mr. Dempsey gathered Chloe’s belongings. Mr. Dempsey told Chloe he had put her pictures in the science book. Chloe
declined taking the book home with her. Mr. Dempsey stated the pictures were in the book, Chloe said she did not want to take them with her. Chloe stated she wanted him to bring the book and pictures to every visit. Mr. Dempsey agreed. Mr. Dempsey carried Chloe’s bicycle down the stairs and they hugged saying goodbye. Chloe and Mr. Dempsey both stated they loved each other and we parted ways.
Chloe and I crossed the street and met the Maternal Grandmother. As we were waiting for the walk sign to cross the street, emergency vehicles came down the street with their lights on.  I made the decision not to cross immediately even though we had the walk sign. As we waited to cross, Chloe made the statement she missed her Maternal Grandmother and wanted to cross the street to be with her. I explained to Chloe I did not know which way the emergency vehicle were going and it would be unsafe to cross the street if they were coming down the same street we were crossing. Chloe acknowledge my statement and began waving and calling to her
Maternal Grandmother.

Person Requesting Report: John Dempsey

Brief Outline of Visitation

This report is in reference to the supervised visitation between John Dempsey and a child, Chloe Murphy. John Dempsey is fic of kin not a biological family member to this child. Therefore, John Dempsey will be referred to as Mr. Dempsey or John throughout this report. I met Maternal Grandmother and Chloe in front of the house. Maternal Grandmother informed
me, Chloe could wear the pink shoes she had on in the water, as her water shoes are too small. She had an additional pair of shoes in the bag. Maternal Grandmother stated Chloe was thin and I agreed Chloe is very slender in build. Chloe and I made our way to the front door where Mr. Dempsey met us. This visit was held at Howard’s home, Mr. Dempsey’s uncle. Howard was present during the visit.
Mr. Dempsey brought food and toys for Chloe. Chloe moved over to Mr. Dempsey’s chair and started to sit on his lap when Mr. Dempsey got up and told Chloe she could have his chair. Mr. Dempsey and Chloe went through the items he brought eating the snacks and playing with the toys. Howard, Mr. Dempsey, and Chloe put the marine sponge animals in water and watched them grow. Mr. Dempsey explained to Chloe his allergies were giving him problems and he was not feeling well so he would be a little slow moving during the visit.
Mr. Dempsey prepared food for Chloe and himself. While eating and conversing, Chloe explained to Mr. Dempsey she is allergic to only one vegetable, yellow squash. Later during the conversation, Chloe asked Mr. Dempsey if he would ever make her do something she did not
 
want to do. Mr. Dempsey said no, not unless it was healthy for her. Chloe said she would not argue with Mr. Dempsey unless he tried to make her eat yellow squash. Mr. Dempsey said he would not do that because it would not be healthy for her. After eating Mr. Dempsey gave Chloe sunscreen to put on before going to the beach. We made our way to the beach where Chloe and Mr. Dempsey played make believe for a long period. Chloe directed the rules and characters.
Mr. Dempsey obliged Chloe and played along with the make believe characters and settings she chose. Mr. Dempsey sat on the hammock while Chloe played in the water during this make believe. Mr. Dempsey also read to Chloe from the science book he had brought. Howard came down to the beach just a few minutes before we left. Chloe explained to him, her and Daddy were fairies and she shape shifted into a mermaid. Howard conversed with Chloe and Mr. Dempsey for a few moments and then we all returned to the house.
After returning to the house, it was decided that Chloe needed to change clothing because she was covered in sand and wet. Chloe asked to take a shower to clean off the sand. I asked Chloe if she needed assistance with the water she said yes. Howard went into the bathroom with us, retrieved a clean towel for Chloe, and put a hand towel in the bottom of the bathtub so she would not slip. Howard left the bathroom and I turned on the water and adjusted the
temperature. I had Chloe test the water to make sure it was not too hot or cold. She said the temperature was right. I turned on the shower and told Chloe to call me when she was done if she needed me to turn off the water. I left the bathroom. After several minutes, Chloe called to me and I returned, shutting off the water. Chloe was out of the bathtub wrapped in a towel. I told Chloe to dry off and get dressed once I left the bathroom, she agreed. I left the bathroom
and several minutes later Chloe came out and stood in front of me quietly holding her pants up. I asked Chloe what was wrong, were her pants too big, she said yes, but she could fix them with rubber bands. Chloe went to let go of the pants to show me, I said no wait a minute let’s fix your pants. Mr. Dempsey was cooking food for them and mentioned he could buy her a belt. Chloe said no I can fix them with rubber bands. I mentioned making a belt from the felt sticks they had been playing with. Mr. Dempsey gathered rubber bands and Chloe made a belt out of the felt sticks. The felt sticks did not work and Chloe tried the rubber bands, which did not work. The pants appeared several sizes too big. Chloe kept adjusting the rubber bands and holding her
pants up. Several times her bottom would show and it was obvious that she was not wearing any underwear.
 
Chloe and Mr. Dempsey sat at the table and played with the marine sponge animals and other toys. They finished eating and Mr. Dempsey started to gather up Chloe’s wet clothes and belongings. Mr. Dempsey and Chloe said goodbye with a hug (Chloe held onto her pants). Howard said goodbye and we made our way to meet Maternal Grandmother in front of the house. I put the bag of wet clothing in the Maternal Grandmother’s car and said goodbye.
End of Report.



Addendum to Report by Christine Hanson:  As documented in previous reports, Chloe arrives to visits wearing pants that are inappropriate or her alternative clothing is inappropriate. Considering the nature of this case, CFS will no longer allow visits that include water activities or that require a change of clothing. Effective immediately, the supervisor will inspect Chloe's clothing to verify that all clothing is appropriate and non-revealing before taking Chloe from the grandmother. If the supervisor determines that Chloe's clothing is inappropriate, the visit will be immediately terminated.

Person Requesting Report: John Dempsey

Brief Outline of Visitation

This report is in reference to the supervised visitation between John Dempsey and a child, Chloe Murphy. John Dempsey is fic of kin not a biological family member to this child. Therefore, John Dempsey will be referred to as Mr. Dempsey or John throughout this report.
This visit began at the Theatre District Trolley stop and continued throughout a museum, antique shops, restaurant, and various local shops.
I met the Maternal Grandmother and Chloe at the trolley stop. Chloe approached me first asking where I had been as she had not seen me in a while. The Maternal Grandmother walked up to me and stated she did not know that I would be supervising, as she was not informed. The Maternal Grandmother stated she had requested that Christine remove me from the case, as she was not happy with my current reports concerning the visits. Maternal Grandmother stated that my reporting was not of her liking due to lack of length and description or information. She then stated my reports were fine in the beginning, I was doing a good job but then began to bring my opinion into the reports concerning John and his behavior. I allowed Maternal Grandmother to finish her explanation of discontent. I then stated to Maternal Grandmother I was not at liberty
to discuss such issues with her. I then looked at Chloe who appeared to be listening to the conversation as she stood by my side. I then explained to Maternal Grandmother that I would not engage in this type of conversation in front of the child, as it was inappropriate. The Maternal Grandmother slightly nodded her head. I then stated, Chloe and I would return to this
 
location to meet her at 8:00 pm. Maternal Grandmother agreed and we parted ways.

Chloe and I met Mr. Dempsey as he crossed the street to the trolley stop. We entered the trolley and Chloe asked to sit on Mr. Dempsey’s lap. Mr. Dempsey declined and asked Chloe to sit in her own seat. Chloe willingly sat in her own seat without objection. Chloe then mentioned to Mr. Dempsey that she wanted to visit the antique shop across the street from the trolley stop. Mr. Dempsey stated, "Sure, let’s go". We exited the trolley and crossed the street. Mr. Dempsey and Chloe walked through the shop talking about and books, statues, toys, household items etc. As we were exiting, Chloe asked to play the video game located by the entry. Mr. Dempsey and Chloe played the video game together. They appeared to be enjoying themselves with smiles
and conversation. We then exited the shop and Chloe mentioned she wanted a hamburger. Mr. Dempsey agreed he would like a burger too. Mr. Dempsey explained to Chloe there were more choices of restaurants down by the museum and she could choose once we reached the area. We rode the trolley to the museum and exited. As we walked along the avenue, we entered shops that Chloe showed interest. Mr. Dempsey told Chloe of a few restaurants her mother liked to enjoy. Mr. Dempsey asked Chloe if she still wanted a burger. Mr. Dempsey gave Chloe a few choices of restaurants and types of food. Chloe chose a hamburger place along the other side of the avenue. We made our way to the restaurant and entered.
We sat and ordered food. While waiting the server gave Chloe and Mr. Dempsey chalk to write on the walls. Mr. Dempsey and Chloe drew on the walls laughing, sharing chalk, and asking each other’s opinions or suggestions on color of chalk or design to apply. Mr. Dempsey and Chloe sat and ate talking about Chloe’s friends at school, her teacher, and general conversation. After eating, we walked down the street to the park where Mr. Dempsey and
Chloe played a type of tag game with make believe monsters. During this game Chloe continued to change the rules. Mr. Dempsey would oblige Chloe by going along with whatever new rule or change she made. Mr. Dempsey never discouraged or corrected Chloe concerning the rule changes or the implementation of new rules although a majority benefitted Chloe. After leaving the park, we visited the History Museum.
During the visit, I noticed several times when Chloe bent over or squatted down her underwear and bottom was exposed. Her pants appeared too big. I asked her if she had a belt to which she replied she did not. John offered to buy Chloe a belt, but she refused to wear a belt. Mr. Dempsey asked Chloe to wear her jacket, as it was long and would cover her backside.
 
As we walked through the museum, Chloe would ask Mr. Dempsey questions about exhibits and he would explain. If Mr. Dempsey were unsure about information, he would read the caption and then explain the information in terms Chloe understood. After leaving the museum, we walked to the trolley stop where Mr. Dempsey read a science book as Chloe ate fruit and listened. Chloe and Mr. Dempsey discussed various topics from the book throughout our wait and trolley ride back to our destination.
On our ride to the museum, Chloe was talking to Mr. Dempsey about her glasses and school. She told Mr. Dempsey that her Maternal Grandmother had hit her hard in the head. Mr. Dempsey sat back a little and then said, “Oh I am pretty sure that was an accident, she probably did not mean too.” Chloe said no, I was hitting my head and my grandma hit me really hard in the head. Mr. Dempsey looked at Chloe and said I am sorry to hear that and I am sorry that happened to you. The subject ended. Chloe also mentioned she had sold her bike a few weeks ago. Mr. Dempsey said he thought she still had the bike. Chloe said no. Mr. Dempsey said she was outgrowing the bike maybe she could get a bigger one soon. Mr. Dempsey asked Chloe to return to the restroom and wash her hands. Mr. Dempsey also provided Chloe with floss and explained why she should floss and showing her how to use it.
When we arrived at our destination, Maternal Grandmother was waiting. Mr. Dempsey and Chloe said goodbye with a hug and we exited the trolley and met Maternal Grandmother.

Summary/Incident Report



Case: Dempsey
Date: Saturday, September 13th, 2014
Time: 1:00pm- 5:00pm
Place: Pt. Defiance Zoo and Aquarium
Supervisor: Sarah
Person Requesting Report: John Dempsey

Brief Outline of Visitation


This report is in reference to the supervised visitation between John Dempsey and Chloe

Murphy. The visit took place at the Point Defiance Zoo and Aquarium in Tacoma, Washington.


The supervisor arrived at 12:55pm and was greeted by the grandmother and Chloe at the top of the stairs. The supervisor asked the grandmother if she would be joining them during the visit. The grandmother told the supervisor that she had some things she needed to take care of, and said goodbye to Chloe and the supervisor, reminding Chloe to stay with the supervisor. Chloe said goodbye, and waited with the supervisor at the top of the stairs. As they waited, a woman with two children passed by and Chloe called out to them. The woman stopped and greeted Chloe, telling her that she had just passed Chloe’s grandmother on the stairs. Chloe said hello to the children. As the woman was saying goodbye, the supervisor noticed Mr. Dempsey waving from the bottom of the steps. The supervisor directed Chloe toward Mr. Dempsey and Mr. Dempsey greeted Chloe with a hug. The supervisor informed Mr. Dempsey that during the last visit she had not corrected Chloe’s behavior when she sat on Mr. Dempsey’s lap. The supervisor apologized to Mr. Dempsey and informed him that this behavior was not allowed in any form, and that Chloe would need to sit next to Mr. Dempsey for all future visits. Mr. Dempsey acknowledged the supervisor and directed Chloe into the zoo. The supervisor introduced herself to Paula Brown, who had been previously approved to attend the visit.
 
Once inside the zoo, Chloe told Mr. Dempsey that she was most excited to see the stingrays. Mr. Dempsey suggested they walk down to the aquarium to find the stingrays. Once inside the aquarium, they explored the ground level and looked at a shark exhibit that was being featured. Chloe found a donation bowl and asked Mr. Dempsey if they could spin a coin down into the bowl. Mr. Dempsey agreed, and together they each spun a coin into the bowl. They
then walked around the aquarium and pointed out different sea creatures. Mr. Dempsey engaged with Chloe as they looked around the aquarium. Paula followed behind. When they reached an interactive portion of the aquarium, Chloe went inside to touch different sea creatures. Mr. Dempsey stood nearby and watched with Paula. When Chloe was finished, they walked back into the aquarium and found the woman and children from the beginning of the visit. Chloe introduced the children, both girls, to Mr. Dempsey and explained that they had met in school. Chloe asked Mr. Dempsey if they could all stay together, and Mr. Dempsey told Chloe it was okay with him.* The girls told Chloe that there was a show happening soon. Chloe asked Mr. Dempsey if they could all attend the show together. Mr. Dempsey agreed, and the group exited the aquarium and began walking toward the show arena. Chloe walked ahead with one of the girls, and then stopped and pointed to the supervisor, telling the girl that she needed to stay
where the supervisor could see her. The supervisor thanked Chloe for remembering.


When they arrived at the arena, Chloe told Mr. Dempsey that she wanted to sit in the

front row. Mr. Dempsey agreed, and Chloe led him to the first row and sat down. Mr. Dempsey sat next to Chloe. The two girls arrived with the woman shortly after, and sat down on the other side of Chloe. The supervisor sat directly behind Chloe, and Paula found a seat several spots down from the supervisor. Before the show began, Paula got up and took a picture of the group. The supervisor leaned away to avoid being part of the picture. Mr. Dempsey pulled out a snack for Chloe, a box of ‘Pocky’ and some rice candy. Chloe took several pieces and shared some with the girls. The show started at 1:30pm and lasted approximately forty-five minutes. At one point during the show, Chloe tried to sit on Mr. Dempsey’s lap. Mr. Dempsey redirected Chloe and said ‘there is a cop here today’. Chloe did not understand and Mr. Dempsey told her the supervisor was with them and would not allow Chloe to sit on his lap. Chloe sat down next to Mr. Dempsey and continued to watch the show.
 
When the show was finished, the zoo staff invited children to the stage to view a couple of animals up close. Chloe went up to the stage and Mr. Dempsey watched from nearby. When Chloe was finished, she walked with Mr. Dempsey and Paula back to the paved path and found the girls and the woman. The woman told Chloe that they were on their way to get ice cream. Chloe told Mr. Dempsey that she wanted to get Dippin’ Dots, and had brought her own money for their visit. Mr. Dempsey told Chloe that he would purchase the Dippin’ Dots for her, and
that she should save her money. On the way to the ice cream, they stopped to view the penguins. When they arrived at the Dippin’ Dots booth, the woman told Chloe that she was going to continue with the girls to the main food pavilion. Chloe asked them to wait, and Mr. Dempsey told Chloe that they would meet them there when they were finished getting the Dippin’ Dots. Mr. Dempsey purchased a bowl of Dippin’ Dots for Chloe, and then together they walked toward the main food pavilion.

When they reached the main food pavilion, Mr. Dempsey noticed that the building was crowded, and suggested that they wait outside for the woman and girls. Mr. Dempsey directed Chloe to a nearby picnic table and together they sat down with Paula and waited for the woman and girls. When the woman and girls arrived, they joined Mr. Dempsey and Chloe at the picnic table and together the girls ate their ice cream and Chloe ate her Dippin’ Dots. As they ate, they talked about the school year and different teachers the girls had had together. When they were finished eating, Chloe asked Mr. Dempsey if they could go in the hurricane simulator nearby. Mr. Dempsey agreed, and Chloe invited her friends to join her in the simulator. Mr. Dempsey paid for the simulator and Chloe and the girls went inside. When the simulation was complete, the girls asked if they could go on the carrousel. The woman told Mr. Dempsey that she would pay for each of the girls to ride the carrousel. Mr. Dempsey agreed, and they walked into the carrousel building. The girls rode on the carrousel two times. The first time, Mr. Dempsey
stood behind Chloe. The second time, Mr. Dempsey watched from the side. Paula took pictures. When they were finished riding on the carrousel, the girls decided they wanted to see the stingrays. Mr. Dempsey agreed, and together they walked back toward the aquarium.

When they arrived at the aquarium, they found the exhibit, and spent several minutes touching the stingrays. When they were finished, the woman told Chloe that they were going to go feed the budgies, invited Chloe to join them, and then directed the girls through the aquarium.
 
Mr. Dempsey agreed, and followed Chloe through the aquarium and toward the budgie exhibit. When they arrived at the budgie exhibit, Paula purchased two seed sticks and followed Chloe into the exhibit with Mr. Dempsey. Chloe fed several budgies and Mr. Dempsey watched, offering her the second seed stick when the first had been eaten. When they were finished feeding the budgies, they exited the budgie exhibit and decided to see the camels. Paula purchased a camel ride for Chloe and Chloe got in line behind the girls to ride the camel. Mr. Dempsey stood by Paula and the woman and watched from behind the fence. Paula and Mr. Dempsey took pictures of Chloe on the camel. When Chloe was finished riding the camel, she asked Mr. Dempsey if she could purchase a bag of cotton candy with her money. Mr. Dempsey told Chloe that she had already had several sugary snacks and that she could not purchase the cotton candy. Chloe argued with Mr. Dempsey, explaining that she had her own money and wanted to purchase the cotton candy. Mr. Dempsey repeated himself to Chloe, and suggested they look for a drinking fountain instead. Chloe began to moan, and Mr. Dempsey told Chloe to stop whining. The woman walked up with the girls and told Mr. Dempsey that they were going to go to the playground next. Mr. Dempsey asked Chloe if she wanted to join her friends on the playground. Chloe did not respond, and continued to moan and turn away from Mr. Dempsey, telling him that she wanted the cotton candy. The woman left with the girls.

Mr. Dempsey continued to tell Chloe that she needed to stop whining, and directed Chloe toward the playground. Chloe drug her feet for several minutes, and then began to run ahead each time Mr. Dempsey got close to her. The supervisor reminded Chloe several times that she needed to stay close. Chloe cried out and when they reached an open patch of grass, she ran around the grass, away from Mr. Dempsey. Mr. Dempsey continued to follow her, suggesting they find a water fountain. Paula pointed to a nearby hill and told Chloe that her friends had stopped to roll down the hill. Chloe saw her friends and joined them on the hill. The girls rolled down the hill together for several minutes. The woman told the girls that they would be leaving in fifteen minutes. The girls continued to roll down the hill until the woman and the girls left.
When the woman and the girls left, Chloe asked Mr. Dempsey again if she could purchase cotton candy. Mr. Dempsey said no. Chloe cried out and then continued running around for several minutes. Mr. Dempsey followed her and the supervisor reminded Chloe again to stay close.
After several minutes, Chloe stopped and lay down under a tree. Mr. Dempsey sat down near
 
Chloe and waited for several minutes for Chloe to calm down. Mr. Dempsey and Paula talked together and asked Chloe if she knew which exhibits were nearby. Chloe found a peacock feather and put it in Mr. Dempsey’s hat. When Chloe began talking with them, Mr. Dempsey suggested they walk toward the food pavilion for some lunch. Chloe got up and together they began to walk toward the food pavilion. On the way, Chloe got upset again, telling Mr. Dempsey that she really wanted to purchase cotton candy. Chloe began dragging her feet and Mr. Dempsey took Chloe’s hand to encourage her to keep walking. When Chloe would no longer walk, they stopped momentarily at a bench and Mr. Dempsey attempted to talk with Chloe. Paula went ahead to the food pavilion. Mr. Dempsey lifted Chloe onto his lap and the supervisor intervened, telling Mr. Dempsey that Chloe needed to sit next to him. Mr. Dempsey repositioned Chloe and talked with her about her behavior before continuing toward the food
pavilion. Mr. Dempsey took Chloe’s hand again, and when Chloe refused to walk, Mr. Dempsey carried her several feet to the food pavilion and then set her down.1


When they reached the food pavilion, Mr. Dempsey directed Chloe to a table and asked her to stay seated until their food arrived. Paula joined them at the table and together Mr. Dempsey and Paula asked Chloe several questions unrelated to the cotton candy. Mr. Dempsey asked Chloe about the french fries and Paula pointed out a picture on the wall, asking Chloe if
she could see the shapes hidden within the picture. When the food arrived, Chloe, Mr. Dempsey, and Paula all shared an order of fish and chips. Mr. Dempsey gave Chloe a bottle of water and together they ate as they talked about the painting on the wall and different exhibits in the zoo. When they were finished, Chloe again asked Mr. Dempsey if she could purchase the cotton candy.  Mr. Dempsey told Chloe that he would purchase a small bag of cotton candy at the end
of the visit for Chloe to take with her. Chloe appeared satisfied, and then asked Mr. Dempsey if they could go back to the carrousel. Mr. Dempsey agreed, and asked Chloe to drink more water before they walked toward the carrousel. Chloe drank more water and then led Mr. Dempsey toward the carrousel. Dr. Dempsey and Chloe rode the carrousel, each on separate horses.
When they were finished, Mr. Dempsey told Chloe that he needed to use the restroom and directed Chloe to sit down with Paula and the supervisor. Chloe sat down and then told the
supervisor that she also needed to use the restroom. The supervisor walked outside with Chloe



1 Mr. Dempsey carried Chloe with one arm under her back and one arm under her legs. Chloe was facing upward.
 
toward the restrooms and told Chloe that she would wait outside the door. Mr. Dempsey passed Chloe on his way out, and told Chloe he would be inside the carrousel building with Paula. Chloe used the restroom and then returned with the supervisor to the carrousel building. Chloe asked Mr. Dempsey if she could go inside the hurricane simulator again. Mr. Dempsey agreed, purchased the hurricane simulation, and went inside the clear booth with Chloe. When the
simulation was over, Chloe walked back into the carrousel building and Paula told Mr. Dempsey that they each had one more carrousel ride. Chloe and Mr. Dempsey rode on the carrousel, with Mr. Dempsey riding on a slug. They then decided to look for the elephant exhibit.

When they arrived at the elephant exhibit, Chloe and Mr. Dempsey talked about the elephants and walked around the Asian animal exhibits nearby. They saw several animals, including a leopard, tiger, and monkey. When they had walked through the Asian animal exhibits, Chloe noticed a photo booth and asked Mr. Dempsey if they could take pictures in the booth together. Mr. Dempsey asked Chloe how much the photo booth cost and after learning the amount, decided to take pictures in the booth. Mr. Dempsey motioned for the supervisor to stand nearby and held the curtain open as they took pictures in the photo booth. When Chloe tried to
sit on Mr. Dempsey’s lap, the supervisor told Chloe she needed to sit next to Mr. Dempsey. Mr. Dempsey lifted Chloe onto the ground and told Chloe she could stand in front instead, if she preferred. Chloe looked at the supervisor and the supervisor told Chloe standing was fine.
Chloe stood in front of Mr. Dempsey and together they took three pictures in the photo booth, and then selected one picture to print. When they were finished, the supervisor reminded Mr. Dempsey that there were approximately sixteen minutes left in the visit. Mr. Dempsey directed Chloe back toward the food pavilion and Chloe confirmed that she would be allowed to purchase cotton candy. Mr. Dempsey said yes, and told Chloe that he would purchase the cotton candy for her.

When they arrived at the food pavilion, Mr. Dempsey purchased a small bag of cotton candy and together they found a table and sat down. Paula sat near them with the supervisor. Mr. Dempsey and Chloe ate the cotton candy together. The supervisor gave Mr. Dempsey a five-minute warning and Mr. Dempsey helped Chloe tie her cotton candy before directing her toward the zoo exit. Chloe walked with Mr. Dempsey to the exit and toward the stairs. When they reached the top of the stairs, the supervisor told Chloe it was time to say goodbye. Mr.
 
Dempsey kneeled down to give Chloe a hug, told her he loved her, and then said goodbye. Mr. Dempsey and Paula continued up the stairs toward the parking lot, and the supervisor walked with Chloe to meet the grandmother at 5:00pm.

End of Report.


Addendum to Report by Christine Hanson:  No one other than pre-approved persons are allowed to attend visits. The supervisor allowed the additional children and their mother, as they were persons known from school and were minors. In the future, no one outside the pre-approved persons will be allowed.

John's comment to Chloe that there was a "cop here today" was inappropriate.

Time: 4:45pm - 7:45pm
Place: Washington Fair, Puyallup
Supervisor: Joleen
Person Requesting Report: John Dempsey

Brief Outline of Visitation


This report is in reference to the supervised visitation between John Dempsey and Chloe

Murphy. The visit took place at the Washington Fair in Puyallup, Washington.


This supervisor met Grandmother Donna and child Chloe outside Cattin's restaurant across from the Gold Gate of the fairgrounds. Grandmother requested John have Chloe's hand stamped so that she could re-enter the fair. She also asked that Chloe ring her mobile when Chloe goes Mutton busting so that she can head over and watch. Donna was not going to be part of the visit other than that and left this supervisor with Chloe to wait for John to arrive.

When John arrived, Chloe greeted him with what appeared to be a high level of excitement, running to him and giving a jumping hug. For the rest of the visit this same behavior would continue as they walked hand in hand throughout the fair. After gaining entrance, Chloe saw a photo booth that she wanted to go in with John and told him to close the curtain. John appropriately responded by keeping the curtain open. I did see that Chloe was sitting on the
outer part of his lap so that her face was in the camera frame.


The visit continued as they walked all through the fairgrounds, stopping at shopping booths, Chloe riding rides and playing games. Chloe appeared to be very excited as evidenced
 
by her bright smiles, almost non-stop talking, and requesting to ride this ride or play this game as they went. A few times John told Chloe “no” and she only would repeat her request once or twice before moving on to the next thing that attracted her attention. Chloe also spent time
riding a pony, going through the petting farm, looking at the Old Time living section as well as the other animals in different areas.

At one point while Chloe was waiting to jump on the trampoline John and this writer were sitting on the bleachers outside the ride waiting. John explained to this writer that he was very happy with the way the reports had been written by other reporters and added that he wasn't expecting me to write a positive report based off his comment. I explained to him that reporters only write on the facts and are not going to interpret how someone feels or what they are
thinking in a report. John expressed that he understood. John also expressed wanting to keep a good relationship with the grandmother as he has been involved in Chloe's life for a long time and intends to stay part of it.

This writer announced when it was time to start heading back to the meeting point and John and Chloe followed through with no issues. On the way out, Chloe got her hand stamped and John gave her all the stuffed animals she had won during the visit. John also gave Donna a ride ticket that Chloe could use for the next time she was at the fairgrounds. John left and this writer left Donna with Chloe outside of Cattin's.

Person Requesting Report: John Dempsey

Brief Outline of Visitation


This report is in reference to the supervised visitation between John Dempsey and Chloe Murphy. The visit took place at the residence of John Dempsey’s mother in Spanaway, Washington.

The grandmother arrived at 1:54pm and met the supervisor outside of Mr. Dempsey’s mother’s residence. She greeted the supervisor and walked around the vehicle to unload Chloe’s bicycle. The grandmother told the supervisor that the email had, indicated twice that the supervisor would be named Sue. The supervisor told the grandmother that she would make the supervising manager aware of the error and apologized for the confusion. Chloe greeted the supervisor and handed her a bag, telling the supervisor that she had brought ice cream and other snacks for the visit. The grandmother told the supervisor that Chloe had a new helmet. Chloe told her grandmother that she wanted to ride her bicycle to the garage, and the grandmother assisted her with her helmet. The supervisor confirmed the visitation end time with the grandmother and directed Chloe toward Mr. Dempsey’s mother’s residence. Chloe said goodbye to her grandmother and rode her bicycle into the garage.

After Chloe set her bicycle against the garage wall, the supervisor directed her to the front door of the house. Chloe let herself into the house and was greeted by Mr. Dempsey and
 
his mother. Chloe told Mr. Dempsey that she had brought ice cream, and the supervisor handed Mr. Dempsey Chloe’s bag. Mr. Dempsey put the ice cream in the freezer and then showed Chloe a collection of items he had set out on the counter. The items included a notebook, glow in the dark silly putty, a set of water activated animal shaped growing sponges, and a Mad Lib activity book. Together Chloe and Mr. Dempsey looked at the items. Chloe decided that she wanted to try growing the animal shaped sponges first. Mr. Dempsey went into the kitchen to retrieve a cup of water for the sponges, and walked with Chloe to the living room where they sat down on a rug together to immerse the sponge capsules in the water. As they waited for the sponges to reveal their shapes, Chloe showed Mr. Dempsey a box filled with supplies to make rubber bracelets. Chloe opened the box and showed Mr. Dempsey how to make a rubber bracelet. Mr. Dempsey engaged with Chloe, asking her questions and leaning in to assist Chloe with the bracelet. Mr. Dempsey’s mother sat in a nearby chair and watched.

After teaching Mr. Dempsey how to make the bracelet, Chloe got up and returned with a stick of beef jerky, which she shared with Mr. Dempsey. Together they played with the rubber bracelet supplies and watched the sponges take form. When Chloe was finished teaching Mr. Dempsey how to make the bracelets, Mr. Dempsey told Chloe that he had brought a Ranger Rick magazine with him to the visit. Chloe voiced her excitement about the Ranger Rick magazine and waited in the living room while Mr. Dempsey retrieved the magazine from the kitchen.
When he returned, Mr. Dempsey sat down on the rug next to Chloe and together they flipped through the magazine, pointing out pictures of animals. Mr. Dempsey read several articles to Chloe and together they talked about the different facts they were learning. As they were
looking at the magazine, Chloe asked Mr. Dempsey if she if she could have some ice cream. Mr. Dempsey told Chloe that he wanted her to have something to eat first, and that they would have ice cream later. When Chloe agreed, Mr. Dempsey offered her several choices for snacks and then handed Chloe a package of Hawaiian rolls, which Chloe happily accepted. As she ate, Mr. Dempsey sat with Chloe and together they continued reading the articles in the Ranger Rick magazine. As Mr. Dempsey read, Chloe got up and returned with a cup of chocolate milk.

When they were finished reading the Ranger Rick magazine, Chloe asked Mr. Dempsey

if they could go for a bicycle ride. Mr. Dempsey agreed, and together they walked outside to the garage. Chloe showed Mr. Dempsey her new helmet and Mr. Dempsey helped Chloe adjust the
 
helmet strap before getting on their bicycles. Chloe led Mr. Dempsey onto the road outside of his mother’s residence and together they started down the street on their bicycles. As they
started down the block, it began to rain and Chloe told Mr. Dempsey that she wanted to return to the house. Together they rode back to the garage, put their bicycles away, and started inside the house. Chloe noticed a wheelchair in the garage and asked Mr. Dempsey if she could ride on it. Mr. Dempsey confirmed with his mother that it was okay to use the wheelchair and then pushed Chloe on the wheelchair into the house. Chloe spent several minutes riding around the house on the wheelchair and then returned to the living room to check on the sponges. As she pulled out the sponges that had taken form, she held them up for Mr. Dempsey to see. Mr. Dempsey talked about the sponges with Chloe and then opened up the notebook he had brought for Chloe, sat down in the living room, and began to write. Mr. Dempsey asked Chloe what she thought he should write about and, after suggesting that they continue the story of ‘Sparkles the Pony’, Chloe went to join Mr. Dempsey on the chair. When Chloe climbed onto Mr. Dempsey’s lap, Mr. Dempsey suggested they sit side by side. Chloe complied with Mr. Dempsey’s request and together they began creating a story.

After writing a portion of their story, Chloe returned to the wheelchair and suggested that they play hospital together. Mr. Dempsey agreed, and together they pretended that Chloe was a patient and Mr. Dempsey was a nurse. Chloe created several hospital themed scenarios and Mr. Dempsey played along. Mr. Dempsey pretended to wrap Chloe’s ankle in a cast, push her
around the house in the wheelchair, and assist her with a couple of Mr. Dempsey’s mother’s canes, which Chloe pretended to use as crutches. Several times, Chloe directed Mr. Dempsey into a nearby bedroom and asked him to join her on the bed. Each time, Mr. Dempsey redirected Chloe by changing the subject or insisting that he was not going to join her on the bed but that he would watch from the doorway. Chloe continued to play hospital with Mr. Dempsey and told
Mr. Dempsey that she had broken her ankle by tripping over a dog named Stanley. When Chloe said the name Stanley, Mr. Dempsey mentioned to Chloe that she would be going to Stanley elementary this year. Chloe continued playing hospital. After they were finished playing hospital, Mr. Dempsey opened a package of gum and offered Chloe a piece. Together they chewed their gum and then Mr. Dempsey suggested they open up the silly putty. After finding a newspaper, Mr. Dempsey directed Chloe to the dining room table and together they pressed the
 
silly putting against the newspaper to lift the ink onto the putty. After playing with the silly putty, Chloe asked Mr. Dempsey if he had heard of the ALS ice bucket challenge and then asked him to complete the challenge. Mr. Dempsey compromised with Chloe and suggested that they complete a ‘stand in the rain’ challenge, instead. Chloe agreed, and together Chloe and Mr. Dempsey went into the backyard and stood in the rain for several seconds.

When they returned inside, Chloe found a dreidel on a nearby shelf and asked Mr. Dempsey what the dreidel was for. Mr. Dempsey directed Chloe to the living room and they sat down on the floor as Mr. Dempsey looked up the history of the dreidel on his phone and Mr. Dempsey’s mother sang the dreidel song. Mr. Dempsey began to explain the directions to the dreidel game, and Mr. Dempsey’s mother got up to retrieve some pennies. Mr. Dempsey found the full version of the song online and played the song as Chloe listened and sang along. When they were done listening to the song, Mr. Dempsey and Chloe began playing the dreidel game and then Chloe decided to try to make a dreidel out of silly putty. As they were playing, Mr. Dempsey played a recorded song of Chloe’s on his phone and Chloe told Mr. Dempsey that she wanted to create a new song for their blog. Chloe began discussing her ideas for the new song, and told Mr. Dempsey what she wanted the blog to look like. Mr. Dempsey listened to her ideas and then wrote down Chloe’s new song in the notebook. Chloe told Mr. Dempsey that she wanted him to make sure that her mother was included on the blog page. Mr. Dempsey and
Chloe began sharing memories of Chloe’s mother and Mr. Dempsey pulled up several pictures of Chloe’s mother on his phone, to show Chloe. At one point, Mr. Dempsey played a video recording of Chloe’s mother singing to Chloe. Chloe listened and then hugged Mr. Dempsey as they remembered her mother.

When they were done watching the video, Chloe checked on the sponges and then returned to the wheelchair. Together Chloe and Mr. Dempsey played hospital. Mr. Dempsey stayed in the living room, as Chloe went back and forth from the wheelchair and the canes, mimicking the need for crutches. Mr. Dempsey got up to pour himself a glass of water and
asked if Chloe was hungry. Mr. Dempsey gave Chloe a glass of water and then put a pizza in the oven. Mr. Dempsey returned to the living room and continued to play hospital with Chloe.
After several minutes, Mr. Dempsey pulled out his tablet. Chloe asked Mr. Dempsey if they could watch a show together. When Mr. Dempsey agreed, Chloe sat down next to Mr. Dempsey
 
on the chair and they began to look for shows to watch. Before deciding on a show, Chloe asked Mr. Dempsey if she could search on the internet first. Mr. Dempsey agreed and Chloe opened google and began to search for a picture of a leopard gecko to show Mr. Dempsey. When they were finished looking at different leopard geckos, they searched for a show to watch. Chloe decided on a superhero show, and together they watched several episodes. When the pizza was ready, Mr. Dempsey got up and asked Chloe if she was hungry. Chloe told Mr. Dempsey she did not like pizza and asked if she could have a piece of cheese instead. Mr. Dempsey’s mother cut Chloe a piece of cheese and then Mr. Dempsey returned to the chair to continue watching the show. As they were eating, Chloe decided she wanted to watch from the wheelchair and got up
to position the wheelchair in front of the tablet. When she was finished eating, Chloe returned to the chair and sat on Mr. Dempsey’s lap for the remainder of the visit.

The supervisor gave Mr. Dempsey a five-minute reminder when the visit was close to ending. Mr. Dempsey watched a couple more minutes of the show with Chloe and then got up to pack her things. Chloe followed and assisted Mr. Dempsey. Chloe then said goodbye and Mr. Dempsey walked with her to the front door. Mr. Dempsey gave Chloe a kiss and said goodbye. The supervisor walked outside with Chloe and reminded her not to forget her bicycle. Chloe got her bicycle from the garage and together they met the grandmother outside of the residence at
6:00pm.

Person Requesting Report: John Dempsey

Brief Outline of Visitation

This report is in reference to the supervised visitation between John Dempsey and a child, Chloe Murphy. John Dempsey is fic of kin not a biological family member to this child. Therefore, John Dempsey will be referred to as Mr. Dempsey or John throughout this report.
This visit was held at Titlow Park. I met the Maternal Grandmother and Chloe in the parking lot at Titlow Park. Maternal Grandmother made sure Chloe had her water shoes, towel, and swimsuit in a bag to take on the visit. Maternal Grandmother told Chloe to enjoy her visit.
Chloe and Maternal Grandmother said goodbye and we started to walk away when Chloe returned to the car to give Maternal Grandmother a hug.
Chloe and I walked to the bridge leading to the Titlow Lodge and met Mr. Dempsey. As soon as Chloe saw Mr. Dempsey, she ran to him with open arms and Mr. Dempsey greeted her with open arms. After hugging and saying hello, Mr. Dempsey encouraged Chloe to lead the way through the park and choose the activity she would like to partake. Chloe chose to beach
comb.

We went to the beach where Mr. Dempsey and Chloe beach combed looking for crab and sea creatures. They conversed about the different creatures identifying them and discussing their physical features. As they were searching the beach, a boy approximately Chloe’s age was catching small crabs. Mr. Dempsey and Chloe joined in and they all began to turn over rocks
and catch crabs, and placing them in a bucket. After some time Mr. Dempsey sat on a rock and
 
watched them, assisting when asked to move rocks or to look at their great catch. The boy’s attitude and character was a little overbearing and Chloe began to argue with him. Mr. Dempsey told the children to work as a team and not to argue. The children played until the boy and his grandparents left. Mr. Dempsey asked Chloe to return the sea creatures to the beach. Chloe wanted to keep them. Mr. Dempsey told Chloe they would not live without salt water. At first, Chloe denied the request and stated she did have a salt-water tank. Mr. Dempsey corrected
Chloe stating she was not telling the truth. Chloe returned the sea creatures to the water. Mr. Dempsey and Chloe decided to make their way to the park.
As we approached the park there were children playing dodge ball associated with Metro Parks. Chloe recognized a girl playing dodge ball and asked permission to play. Mr. Dempsey gave Chloe permission and she gained permission from the adult staff supervising the game. Chloe played dodge ball until the end of the visit. Mr. Dempsey called Chloe in and notified her it was time to leave. We made our way to the bridge where we had met Mr. Dempsey at the beginning of the visit. We waited there until the Maternal Grandmother arrived. Mr. Dempsey and Chloe said goodbye with hugs. Chloe and I walked to the Maternal Grandmother’s vehicle where we parted.
Observations: Mr. Dempsey allows Chloe to play and explore with other children without interfering in their play until adult guidance is needed. Mr. Dempsey engaged with Chloe during the visit. His involvement was limited while she played with the boy except when the children asked for his help. Mr. Dempsey does not have a problem setting boundaries with Chloe and he enforces them when necessary.
End of Report.

No prediction is intended about how contacts between the same parent(s) and child (ren) might occur in a less protected setting and without supervision. Care should be exercised by the users of these observations making such predictions.

Brief Outline of Visitation


This report is in reference to the supervised visitation between John Dempsey and a child, Chloe Murphy. John Dempsey is fic of kin not a biological family member to this child. Therefore, John Dempsey will be referred to as Mr. Dempsey or John throughout this report.
This visit was held at Howard’s home, Mr. Dempsey’s uncle. Howard was present during the visit.
I arrived at 2:00 pm and awaited the arrival of Chloe and her Maternal Grandmother. They arrived a few minutes after 2:00 pm. I stepped out of my car and introduced myself to the Maternal Grandmother and then Chloe came out of the car.  I introduced myself to her as well. Grandmother then left the area in her car, after stating she would be back at 6:00 pm.
I took Chloe by the hand until she reached the stairway that led to the entrance to the home and she ran ahead, down the stairs to jump into the arms of a man who held them open for her.  I saw him stand up from sitting on a bench in front of the home right before Chloe jumped into his arms. He said hello to me and introduced himself as “John”. John swung Chloe around a couple of times then she stated “Oh, my back”, to which John asked her “what happened to your back” and Chloe stated, “Oh, it happened at McDonalds”. John’s
 
Uncle Howard met us at the door, held out his hand, and introduced himself as well. We all then went inside the home.
Chloe and John went into the living area to play games of being “pretend animals” and chasing each other back and forth across the room. Several times John and Howard asked if Chloe would like to go outside to which she replied she would like to stay in and play longer. Chloe directed most of the play, stated what she was and what she wanted John to be and do. John followed along. This play continued for around an hour.
John then persuaded Chloe to get ready to go outside to go to play at the beach. Chloe had difficulty putting on her shoes and John assisted.
I followed Howard, John, and Chloe down to the beach where they played for the next two hours. Chloe called John “Dad” several times and called him “Mama” once to which John replied, “Yes Bobcat?” John had asked Chloe if she wanted to play “store” where they went to an area that was under the dock and sat down under it to play as if each were a different kind of animal. Chloe was expressive in her play physically and verbally, often jumping towards John and he would pick her up but hold her to his side, as well as frequently glance in my direction. I stood nearby with both Chloe and John in full view. Chloe once stated she was “nocturnal” and used an extensive vocabulary to describe whom and what she was playing, often talking as a British-speaking person speaking with an accent, to which John would reply in kind.
Several jellyfish were beached on the sand and Chloe used a long stick to pick them up and return them to the ocean. At one point, another jellyfish was in the ocean, at a distance, and Chloe said, “Hey they want to be boyfriend and girlfriend!” Chloe then attempted pushing the one jellyfish closer to the other.
At 4:00 pm we were all still on the beach as the tide began to come in. Chloe and John had made a mountain of sand in an area they were playing and as the water came towards it Chloe picked up a tall stick and began hitting the water over and over , yelling “NO I WILL SAVE YOU” . Talking about the Sand Island she and John had made. Howard had put a shell on top of it and so Chloe called the island of sand “Crab Island”. She continued hitting the water , over and over, yelling in a British accent “NO I WILL SAVE YOU” to which John also would join in and they walked back and forth, he on the beach and she now in the
 
water , continuing to yell at the water to not take over their island. Chloe was wearing shorts and had taken off her shoes. By this time, her shorts were wet.
Around 5:00 pm, Howard said to John to get a towel he had on the deck near where we were and to wrap it around Chloe. John went to get the towel and went to Chloe to wrap her up in it and she asked him if the next time they could go to the wave pool to which John replied he would ask. John sat Chloe down on the towel to put her shoes on to which she did not want to do. John told her that it was a battle of the wills and when she was 14, she could decide. John then asked her how ice cream sounded to which she became more cooperative in the effort of putting on her shoes. He asked her if she would like popcorn as well, to
which she replied “no”.

Howard, John, Chloe, and I walked back up the trail to the house and Howard asked Chloe not to return to the living area, as she was wet and sandy. Once in the house Howard, John and Chloe sat at the table near the door and I sat in a chair nearby. Howard dished up ice cream, offered me some as well to which I declined, but thanked him. John talked about teaching high school when he was in college and about having a great time in college to which Chloe shook her head “no”. John asked Chloe what she would like to be and she said she wanted to be a dentist to which John replied, “Well you would need to go to college for that”. John then talked about things he was allergic to, what an Allergist does, and that they also have to go to college. Chloe stated, “You talk too much” to which John replied, “Is that a nice thing to say?”
John reminded Chloe of when they went to Seattle to see the movie in the park “Peewee’s Big Adventure” and Chloe said, “That was fun”. John talked about a friend he had that made bicycles that can carry things like Chloe and that maybe he could borrow one to take Chloe around Seattle waterfront.
Chloe asked John if she could play on his laptop and he said yes she could play with his tablet. He got his tablet and sat it on the table. They began looking for games and found a game that was about a cartoon monster. Chloe played the game up until time to get ready to leave. A few minutes before time to leave John picked up some items that he had gotten out of a back pack which he had shown to Chloe, that were makeup and some cards. He picked up a small plastic baggy and put the items in the baggy then put two letters in the baggy. I
checked with my supervisor and then told John he would need to give the letters to his

He sat the letters down on his tablet and told Chloe it was time and she stood up and gave him a hug around the neck and told him she loved him and he told her the same.

Brief Outline of Visitation

This report is in reference to the supervised visitation between John Dempsey and a child, Chloe Murphy. John Dempsey is fic of kin not a biological family member to this child. Therefore, John Dempsey will be referred to as Mr. Dempsey or John throughout this report.
This visit was held at various locations in downtown Tacoma. I met Chloe and Maternal Grandmother at the Theatre District Trolley stop on Commerce Street. Maternal Grandmother said goodbye to Chloe. Chloe and I met Mr. Dempsey at the crosswalk next to the trolley stop. Mr. Dempsey and Chloe greeted with hugs and smiles. We boarded the trolley and rode to the Museums on Pacific Avenue.
Mr. Dempsey asked Chloe which museum she would like to visit first. Chloe chose the Glass Museum. They walked and talked about memories of past visits to museums and places with Chloe’s mother. They walked through the museum looking at various pieces discussing their favorites and what was appealing about those pieces. Mr. Dempsey and Chloe drew pictures and entered Chloe’s drawing to be chosen for a future glass piece.
We entered the main lobby to a dancing performance underway. Chloe immediately

asked Mr. Dempsey to dance with her. Mr. Dempsey did not hesitate to comply and fully engage in dancing with Chloe. They continued to dance for several minutes. Chloe would instruct and direct their performance and Mr. Dempsey would willfully comply. The audience turned their attention to Chloe and Mr. Dempsey. An audience member approached them and commended
 
them on their performance. We walked along the walkway next to the water. Chloe expressed wishes for future visit locations. Mr. Dempsey explained to Chloe that he has a mental list of these locations and would see what he can do. Mr. Dempsey told Chloe her maternal grandmother had to be asked and agree to the locations.
We made our way to the trolley and rode the trolley to our original destination. As we came to the stop, Chloe and Mr. Dempsey said goodbye. Mr. Dempsey exited the trolley at the opposite end as the Maternal Grandmother was waiting at the trolley stop. Chloe and I exited the trolley and greeted the Maternal Grandmother.
Mr. Dempsey does not have a problem setting boundaries for Chloe. Chloe stated she was hungry. Mr. Dempsey gave her options of different food items available to include fruit, chips, and drink. Chloe did not want the items Mr. Dempsey had to offer. After much debate, Chloe conceded and ate the available food and appeared satisfied.
Mr. Dempsey encourages Chloe to use her imagination. Mr. Dempsey allows Chloe to lead their make believe play. When Chloe asks a question about a situation in their make believe play and whether it could be possible, Mr. Dempsey explains the reality of it, but encourages her to make believe however she chooses.
Mr. Dempsey willfully without hesitation engages with Chloe regardless the audience. Example is the dancing in the museum lobby.

Brief Outline of Visitation


This report is in reference to the supervised visitation between John Dempsey and Chloe Murphy. The visit took place at the residence of John Dempsey’s mother in Spanaway, Washington.

The grandmother arrived at 12:25pm and met the supervisor outside of Mr. Dempsey’s mother’s residence. She introduced herself to the supervisor and walked around the vehicle to unload Chloe’s bicycle. Chloe greeted the supervisor and showed her a piece of beef jerky. Chloe asked the supervisor if she could bring the beef jerky with her to the visit. With the grandmother’s approval, the supervisor agreed. The grandmother reminded Chloe to make sure she had her helmet, and handed Chloe her bicycle. Chloe said goodbye to her grandmother and walked her bicycle into the garage. When Chloe began to walk toward a door in the garage, the supervisor directed Chloe toward the front door of the house, and together they met Mr. Dempsey in the front room. Mr. Dempsey greeted Chloe, and introduced the supervisor to his mother, who remained present during the visit.

Mr. Dempsey directed Chloe to the backyard where they found a bean plant and decided to pick some beans with Mr. Dempsey’s mother. Mr. Dempsey talked about the bean plant as they picked beans. Chloe asked questions about the bean plant and together they filled a bowl
 
brought out by Mr. Dempsey’s mother. When they were finished picking beans, Chloe walked around the backyard with Mr. Dempsey and looked at the different plants in the yard. Chloe looked for bugs and asked Mr. Dempsey to help her remove any spiders that she found. Mr. Dempsey noticed a plant that needed to be watered and went into the house to fill a watering can. When he returned, he handed the watering can to Chloe who watered a flowerpot. When she
was finished watering the flowerpot, they decided to go inside to play ‘the marble game’. Chloe and Mr. Dempsey took turns hiding a marble around the room while the other sat with their eyes closed. Mr. Dempsey’s mother sat and watched as they played. When they were finished playing, Mr. Dempsey offered Chloe a glass of water. Chloe declined, and told Mr. Dempsey that she wanted to ride her bicycle. Mr. Dempsey agreed, and Chloe ran outside ahead of Mr. Dempsey. Chloe put on her helmet and began riding her bicycle in front of the driveway. Mr. Dempsey followed, and together they rode their bicycles back and forth on the street in front of the house.

As they rode their bicycles, Mr. Dempsey reminded Chloe to stay close to the house and to be watchful of passing cars. Mr. Dempsey asked Chloe about ‘Camp Sparkle’ and if she got to go swimming while she was there. Chloe continued to ride her bicycle and then asked Mr. Dempsey if he wanted to race. Mr. Dempsey agreed, and reminded Chloe of the boundaries she needed to stay within. Together they raced up and down the street, stopping at an appropriate
distance and then returning. When they finished racing, Mr. Dempsey suggested that they take a walk to a nearby playground. Chloe said no, and told Mr. Dempsey that she wanted to play with a set of car seats that had been removed from Mr. Dempsey’s mother’s vehicle, and were sitting in the garage. Mr. Dempsey explained that the seats were not stable on their own, and helped Chloe set a couple of them up against the back wall of the garage. Chloe and Mr. Dempsey sat down in the seats and talked together. Chloe noticed a lamp in the garage that was hers and Mr. Dempsey told her she was welcome to take the lamp home. Chloe said no and then asked Mr. Dempsey if she could have something to drink. Mr. Dempsey told Chloe that she could have water or orange juice. Chloe decided on orange juice and Mr. Dempsey’s mother offered to bring a glass of orange juice out to the garage. When she returned, Chloe asked Mr. Dempsey about Brianna. Mr. Dempsey listened as Chloe asked about Brianna and then told her that he would try to see if Brianna could join them next time. Chloe then decided it would be fun to
 
pretend they were from England and asked Mr. Dempsey to talk in an accent. Together they spoke in English accents and pretended they were driving a car around England. They created alias for themselves and imagined they were rich and famous, riding around England in a limo together. They developed a story for themselves and played pretend as they sat side by side in the car seats. Chloe soon decided that she wanted to be a guest on ‘America’s Got Talent’. Mr. Dempsey played host of the show and narrated as Chloe preformed several imaginary acts. She stood up and sang a song as Mr. Dempsey sat and listened with his mother. Next, she decided to dance around the garage and invited Mr. Dempsey to join her. When they were finished
dancing, Chloe directed Mr. Dempsey to their bicycles and they preformed a bicycle routine together. When they were finished, Chloe asked Mr. Dempsey’s mother if she could play her violin. Mr. Dempsey’s mother agreed, and the three walked into the front room of the house. Mr. Dempsey’s mother helped Chloe set up the violin and handed it to Chloe who sat down in a
chair to play. Together they listened as Chloe played a couple of improvised songs on the violin. Mr. Dempsey took a video on his phone of Chloe playing.

When she was finished playing violin, Chloe asked Mr. Dempsey if she could watch a movie. Mr. Dempsey told her that she could watch a movie at 3:30pm, but not until then. Mr. Dempsey asked Chloe if she wanted to draw a picture. Chloe said no, and then told Mr.
Dempsey that she was hungry. Mr. Dempsey gave her a few options for food, and Chloe decided on an apple and asked if it could be peeled. Mr. Dempsey’s mother assisted Chloe by peeling the apple and then asking if there was anything else she wanted. Chloe took the apple and then took Mr. Dempsey’s hand and together they returned to the garage to sit down. As Chloe ate her
apple, they pretended they were riding in a limo and used English accents. Mr. Dempsey asked Chloe again about Camp Sparkle and what her favorite part of camp had been. Chloe told Mr. Dempsey that the whole thing was her favorite part, and reminded him that it had only been a weeklong camp. Mr. Dempsey then asked the supervisor if she knew how to ride a bicycle, telling her that he had an extra bicycle if she wanted to ride with them around the neighborhood. The supervisor told Mr. Dempsey that she knew how to ride a bicycle but that she would be walking during the visit and not riding with them. She told Mr. Dempsey that if they wanted to ride around the neighborhood, they would just need to stay an appropriate length from the supervisor. Mr. Dempsey agreed and explained this to Chloe, asking if she wanted to go for a
 
bicycle ride around the neighborhood. Chloe agreed, and together they put on their helmets and rode their bicycles into the neighborhood. Mr. Dempsey took care to stay close to the supervisor as she walked behind them and directed Chloe to slow down and wait, when she got too far ahead.  Mr. Dempsey reminded Chloe to watch for passing cars, and together they rode around the neighborhood on their bicycles.

At one point, after being told to wait, Chloe pulled her bicycle up to a patch of grass and lay down. Mr. Dempsey got off his bicycle and sat down next to her in the grass. When Mr. Dempsey sat down, Chloe got up and began to climb on Mr. Dempsey’s shoulders. The supervisor intervened and asked Chloe to get off Mr. Dempsey’s shoulders. The supervisor told Chloe that she could sit down next to Mr. Dempsey, but that she could not be on top of him. Chloe quickly got off Mr. Dempsey’s shoulders and sat down silently next to Mr. Dempsey. Chloe then asked Mr. Dempsey if he remembered giving her a ride on his bicycle during a past visit. Mr. Dempsey said yes, and then lifted Chloe onto his bicycle, put one hand on her back and then walked beside her, pushing the bike around in front of the patch of grass. When he was finished, he helped Chloe off the bicycle and they returned to the patch of grass to sit down. Mr. Dempsey turned his bicycle upside down and began to show Chloe how the brakes on a bicycle work. Chloe sat on one side of the bicycle, and Mr. Dempsey sat on the other, and together they spun the wheels of the bicycle in circles and practiced stopping the wheels by pressing the brake handles on the bicycle. When they were finished, they returned to their bicycles and rode back
to the house, staying close to the supervisor.


When they returned to the house, they set their bicycles against the garage and sat down in the car seats. Chloe asked Mr. Dempsey about English accents and Mr. Dempsey explained how there are many different types of accents. As they talked, Mr. Dempsey noticed that Chloe’s hands were covered in dirt from the bicycle tires. Mr. Dempsey directed Chloe to the restroom and began to lift her up to carry her. Chloe reminded Mr. Dempsey that they supervisor had intervened when they were in the grass. Mr. Dempsey acknowledged Chloe’s reminder, and put Chloe on the ground to walk to the restroom. Mr. Dempsey helped Chloe wash her hands and when they were finished, directed her into the living room, and began going through a pile of books. Chloe asked Mr. Dempsey for some cheese, and Mr. Dempsey walked into the kitchen to prepare a plate of cheese and crackers for them to share. When he was
 
finished preparing the plate of cheese and crackers, Mr. Dempsey directed Chloe back to the garage where they continued to play pretend. Chloe developed an elaborate story involving several animal characters, and together she and Mr. Dempsey played pretend as they ate cheese and crackers.

After playing together, Chloe asked Mr. Dempsey if it was time to watch ‘Wink’s Club’. Mr. Dempsey considered the time and then agreed, asking Chloe to help him clean up their dishes first. Chloe carried their dishes inside and then found Mr. Dempsey’s tablet. Mr. Dempsey opened the show on his tablet and sat down in a chair. Chloe approached Mr. Dempsey and asked him if she could sit on his lap as they watched. Mr. Dempsey told Chloe that she could sit next to him, and together they sat side by side in the chair and began watching
‘Wink’s Club’. When the episode was over, Mr. Dempsey began brainstorming ideas with Chloe about what to do next. Mr. Dempsey made several suggestions and together they decided to walk to a nearby playground. As they were getting ready to leave, Chloe asked Mr. Dempsey if they could read a book first. Mr. Dempsey agreed, and Chloe selected the book ‘The Giving Tree’ from a nearby pile and sat down next to Mr. Dempsey. She read the book aloud, then took Mr. Dempsey’s hand, and led him outside to begin their walk to the playground.

Mr. Dempsey’s mother decided to join, and together they began to walk in the direction of the playground. After walking several feet, Chloe stopped and told Mr. Dempsey that she did not want to walk anymore. She asked Mr. Dempsey if he would carry her. Mr. Dempsey told Chloe that he could not carry her but asked if she wanted to ride her bicycle to the playground instead.  Chloe agreed and ran back to the garage to get her bicycle. Mr. Dempsey decided he would also ride his bicycle and reminded Chloe that they would need to stay close together if they were going to ride their bicycles. Chloe agreed and together they started in the direction of the playground. Mr. Dempsey’s mother walked behind and opened the gate at the end of the neighborhood. When they arrived at the main road, Mr. Dempsey reminded Chloe to stay on the sidewalk and ride slowly with the group. Chloe stopped her bicycle and began saying that her
head was hurting. She removed her helmet and put both hands on her head. Mr. Dempsey asked if she was okay, and then suggested that they push their bicycles and walk. Chloe told Mr. Dempsey that it felt like her head was being squished and Mr. Dempsey stopped several times to make sure Chloe was okay. As they continued toward the playground, Chloe stopped and cried
 
out. She repeated to Mr. Dempsey that it felt like her head was being swished. Mr. Dempsey stopped, asked Chloe if she was okay, and then gave her a hug. When he was finished giving her a hug, Chloe appeared to feel better. Chloe then put her helmet on, returned to her bicycle, and rode ahead to the playground.

They arrived at the playground at 3:07pm. Chloe quickly noticed a group of children who were riding bicycles up and down a small hill next to the playground and decided to join them.  Mr. Dempsey stood nearby and watched as Chloe rode her bicycle up and down the hill with the other children. Mr. Dempsey reminded Chloe to watch for passing cars and stood at the bottom of the hill to make sure she was safe. Chloe spent the next hour playing with the children on the hill. Several times, Mr. Dempsey joined the children on his bicycle and rode together
with them on the hill. The children engaged with Mr. Dempsey and at one point, an older boy asked Mr. Dempsey if he could ride his bicycle. Mr. Dempsey allowed the older boy to ride his bicycle, and watched nearby as the children played together. Chloe spent the majority of the time on her bicycle, stopping several times to play on a skateboard with the other children. Mr. Dempsey watched Chloe and the children play, and mentioned several times to the supervisor
that he did not think Chloe was getting enough exercise at home. The supervisor did not respond to Mr. Dempsey’s concerns. Mr. Dempsey talked to his mother about his concerns and together they watched as the children played. When the other children brought out a bottle of juice,
Chloe asked Mr. Dempsey for something to drink. Mr. Dempsey explained that he did not have anything to drink but that they could walk back to the house if she was thirsty. Chloe continued to ride her bicycle with the other children and Mr. Dempsey engaged with them as they rode by.

At 4:05pm, Mr. Dempsey told Chloe that it was time to walk back to the house and told the older boy that he would need to return the bicycle. Chloe said goodbye to the other children and as they began to ride back toward the house, Chloe started to whine and stopped in the middle of the road. Mr. Dempsey instructed Chloe to walk. Chloe refused to walk and put her hands on her head, crying out that her head felt like it was being squished. Mr. Dempsey told Chloe to take off her helmet. Chloe began to cry out, holding her head and saying ‘no, no, no, no, no’. Mr. Dempsey again told Chloe to take off her helmet. Chloe took off her helmet and threw it on the ground. When it hit the ground, the top of the helmet cracked and Mr. Dempsey asked Chloe to pick up her helmet and walk with her bicycle back to the house. Chloe shook her
 
head and the supervisor asked Chloe if she would like her to carry the helmet for her. Chloe nodded, handed the supervisor the helmet and began pushing her bike. After several feet, Chloe stopped walking and Mr. Dempsey took her bike and told Chloe to continue walking. Chloe walked next to Mr. Dempsey on the sidewalk and together they walked back toward the house. Chloe continued to make sounds of displeasure, but walked next to Mr. Dempsey toward the house. When they arrived back at the neighborhood, Mr. Dempsey’s mother unlocked the gate and they walked back to the house.

They arrived at the house at 4:13pm and went into the living room. Mr. Dempsey offered

Chloe water and ice cream. Chloe said she only wanted water and began breathing heavily as she told Mr. Dempsey repeatedly that she needed water. Mr. Dempsey gave her a glass of water and sat down across from her as she drank the water. Chloe had two glasses of water and then Mr. Dempsey offered Chloe a bowl of vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup. Mr. Dempsey’s mother prepared three bowls of ice cream and then joined Mr. Dempsey and Chloe in the living room. Together they ate their ice cream as they waited for the visit to end. Mr. Dempsey assured Chloe that next time they decided to take a walk he would pack a bottle of water for her
to drink. Mr. Dempsey asked Chloe if she was excited for school to start and they talked about a recital Chloe preformed in earlier in the year. At 4:27pm, the supervisor told Chloe it was time
to say goodbye. Chloe told Mr. Dempsey that she did not want to go, and asked if she could take her ice cream with her. Mr. Dempsey told Chloe that she could not take the ice cream with her, but that maybe they could have ice cream again during their next visit. Chloe gave Mr. Dempsey a hug and said goodbye. Chloe walked outside with the supervisor, got her bicycle from the garage, and met the grandmother in front of the house at 4:30pm.

Summary/Incident Report



Case: Dempsey
Date: 8-11-14
Place: Wrights Park, Tacoma Time: 2:00 pm – 6:00 pm Supervisor: Charlotte
Person Requesting Report: John Dempsey

Brief Outline of Visitation

This report is in reference to the supervised visitation between John Dempsey and a child, Chloe Murphy. John Dempsey is fic of kin not a biological family member to this child. Therefore, John Dempsey will be referred to as Mr. Dempsey or John throughout this report.
This visit was held at Wrights Park in Tacoma. I walked to the corner of the park across from the coffee shop where Mr. Dempsey was to meet Chloe and me at 4:20 pm. At 4:31 pm, I heard someone calling to me from across the street at the coffee shop. I identified Chloe, Mr. Dempsey and a gentlemen, I assumed was Richard (Chloe’s Step Maternal Grandfather). I immediately called our agency office and spoke to Christine about the situation. I crossed the street and identified the gentlemen as Richard at which time I informed him the meeting location was across the street not at the coffee shop. Richard said he was instructed to bring Chloe to the coffee shop. Christine then spoke to Richard on my cellular phone, instructing him to meet across the street at the end of the visit 6:30 pm. Richard left the area, Mr. Dempsey, Chloe and I walked across the street to the park.
Mr. Dempsey had brought Chloe’s bicycle and helmet, which she rode while we walked. I explained to Mr. Dempsey the situation with the drop off and pick up at the visits was not following our agency guidelines and is becoming an issue. Mr. Dempsey stated he did not know what to do when they showed up; he could not just leave the location in which he was instructed to remain at drop off and pick up exchanges. The conversation ended.
 
Mr. Dempsey asked Chloe what she would like to do and gave her several different choices such as, waterpark, different areas of park, or the toy store. Chloe asked Mr. Dempsey if they could go to the toy store. As we made our way to the store, Mr. Dempsey reminded Chloe how to ride her bicycle safely and use her breaks. We arrived at the toy store where Mr. Dempsey and Chloe looked through the toys, cards and stuffed animals. Mr. Dempsey gave Chloe a budget of $6 dollars she could spend. Chloe picked out a stuffed animal and cards.
After leaving the toy store Chloe complained of the heat. Mr. Dempsey said he was concerned about her being hydrated and suggested the frozen yogurt store or a restaurant where she could have a hamburger. Chloe chose the frozen yogurt store.
We crossed the street and entered the frozen yogurt store where Mr. Dempsey and Chloe had self-serve yogurt. Mr. Dempsey suggested eating upstairs in a lounge area where there was a television on with children’s programs. Mr. Dempsey and Chloe ate their frozen yogurt,
watched television; Chloe made a video on Mr. Dempsey’s phone and drew pictures. Chloe asked to use the restroom. Mr. Dempsey and I waited for Chloe to return from the restroom, when Chloe opened the restroom door, Mr. Dempsey reminded her to wash her hands.
During this visit Mr. Dempsey set boundaries for Chloe and enforced them such as, she took a bowl from the self-serve area and Mr. Dempsey told her to put it back. At first Chloe did not listen, then Mr. Dempsey in a stern voice told her to put the bowl back. Chloe complied then asked the attendant and was granted permission to take a bowl. As we were leaving the upstairs, Chloe took her bicycle and started toward the stairway. Mr. Dempsey told her to wait - Chloe proceeded forward. Mr. Dempsey asked her again and when she continued in the forward motion, Mr. Dempsey in a stern voice told her to wait. Chloe complied. Each time Mr.
Dempsey had to use a stern voice in controlling Chloe’s behavior, he would explain why he was giving her the instruction.
After leaving the frozen yogurt store, we walked back to the coffee shop across from Wrights Park. As we approached the parking lot of the coffee shop, Mr. Dempsey noticed Richard waiting across the street. Mr. Dempsey was saying goodbye to Chloe when Richard crossed the street. Mr. Dempsey said goodbye to Chloe and said he would see her this weekend. Chloe said goodbye and asked if she could take her bicycle. Mr. Dempsey allowed her to take
the bicycle as it belongs to her. Richard did not contest the bicycle going home. Richard, Chloe, and I walked across the street and parted ways. I explained to Richard that there should not be
 
any contact between the parties and Chloe is not to have contact with Mr. Dempsey without the Supervisor present. Richard said he was not aware of procedure and just knew he was to drop off and pick up Chloe.
Throughout the entire visit Chloe referred to Mr. Dempsey as dad and daddy. End of Report.
Addendum to Report by Christine Hanson: Upon receiving Charlotte's telephone call that the dropping off person did not follow the confirmed instructions; I asked to speak with Richard on her phone. I explained the dropping off/picking up procedure to Richard and clearly told him to meet Charlotte across the street after the visit. In reading Charlotte's report, Richard failed to follow my after-visit instructions. After speaking to Richard, I sent the following e-mail to Donna:
Donna,

Richard did not meet Charlotte across the street as you indicated he would in your e-mail and in the confirmation e-mail. I spoke with Richard about the exchange arrangements. He indicated that you never told him to meet
Charlotte across the street. When Charlotte arrived today - after waiting across
the street for Richard, she finally found  him at the coffee shop with Chloe and
John.

There have been numerous problems when you employ others to conduct the exchange before and after each visit. Having others provide transportation places Chloe in an unsupervised setting and causes unnecessary and additional work for our agency and supervisor.

If you wish for CFS to continue supervising these visits, we will only accept and release the child to you before and after every visit. If you are unable to bring the child to the visit and pick her up afterwards, then the visit will not be scheduled or confirmed.

Richard my husband will be dropping off Chloe at the corner across from the coffee shop. He will also pick Chloe up at 6:30 at the same spot. This will work.

This visit was held at Howard’s home, Mr. Dempsey’s uncle. Howard and Epona were present during this visit. Epona is Mr. Dempsey’s niece. I arrived at 2:05 pm and met the Maternal Grandmother and Chloe in front of the house. The Maternal Grandmother stated she could not get Chloe to change her shorts and the Maternal Grandmother felt they were very short. The shorts were very short. When Chloe bends over, her behind shows at the bottom of her shorts. Chloe and I met Mr. Dempsey at the front door. Chloe immediately hugged Mr. Dempsey and he returned the hug.

Chloe said hello to Epona and Howard. Mr. Dempsey asked if Chloe wanted to walk to a nearby park where there is a children’s play area. Chloe said she would rather stay at the house. Mr. Dempsey said that was fine. Chloe asked about the hammock where Mr. Dempsey had recently been injured. Mr. Dempsey stated it was a freak accident and that Uncle Howard had fixed the hammock. Mr. Dempsey explained the definition of a freak accident to Chloe. Mr.
 
Dempsey also reassured Chloe that Uncle Howard had fixed the hammock and now it was stronger than ever. Chloe told John the accident was her fault and that she had been doing it wrong. Mr. Dempsey said there was no way the accident was her fault and hugged her. Chloe put her head on Mr. Dempsey. Mr. Dempsey said she did not have to play on the hammock anymore if she does not want to. They had snacks and water before we left for the beach. Chloe cut her finger cutting an M&M.

Chloe said nothing, and then replied that she peed. Chloe tried to cross the barrier wall into the neighbors beach area, Mr. Dempsey told her to stay on the side we were on. Chloe complied. Chloe chased the geese and bent to grab a rock. Mr. Dempsey told her not to throw rocks at the geese, Chloe complied.

This visit was held at the Pierce County Fair in Graham. Mr. Dempsey’s Mother was present during this visit.
There was a lot of confusion as to where to drop off and pick up Chloe at this visit. I would ask that in the future all parties adhere to the transportation, and exchange plans as indicated in the confirmation e-mail. As a professional supervisor, it is my responsibility to ensure the safety of the child and that all parties abide by the guidelines.
I arrived at the fairgrounds and called Melissa who was to drop off and exchange Chloe with me. Melissa did not answer her cellular phone. I left a message giving instruction to meet me at the pay booth to the parking area as previously discussed in the email. Mr. Dempsey met me at the pay booth, where he paid for my parking and ensured I received a fair admission ticket. Mr. Dempsey had also purchased a ticket in advance for Chloe to enter the fair with me. Mr. Dempsey and I agreed to meet at the walk in entrance to the fair after I received Chloe. I parked my car and received a call from Melissa who had already entered the fair through the pedestrian entrance and at that time made contact with Mr. Dempsey. I asked Melissa to not leave Mr. Dempsey and Chloe until I had made my way to their location. As I walked toward their
 
location, Mr. Dempsey and Chloe were making their way to me.

Chloe appeared very excited speaking very fast and excited with her eyes fixed on Mr. Dempsey. Mr. Dempsey appeared happy and excited while engaged in this conversation with Chloe. We entered the walk gate and met Melissa and Mr. Dempsey’s Mother. I confirmed with Melissa that I would meet the Maternal Grandmother at the pay booth at the end of the visit to exchange Chloe. I informed her there was plenty of room on the roadway for the Maternal Grandmother to pull over and park to wait without entering the fair parking lot. Melissa
informed me that Chloe’s fair admission was already paid for as they entered through the pedestrian gate. I returned the ticket to Mr. Dempsey that he had previously purchased for
Chloe.

Mr. Dempsey engaged with Chloe throughout the entire visit. They rode on the bumper cars in separate cars. They laughed and smiled bumping into each other and other people. Mr. Dempsey allowed Chloe to set the pace of the visit asking her which activity she would like to do next. They conversed throughout the fair about each activity. Mr. Dempsey and Chloe
conversed about the animals, insects, artwork, flowers, and plants. Chloe wanted to play in the bouncy house.
As we approached the bouncy house, the attendant wanted Mr. Dempsey to sign paperwork with a signature of a parent or guardian. Chloe stated Mr. Dempsey was really not
her dad but like her dad. Mr. Dempsey stated he was neither her legal parent nor guardian at this time. The attendant was adamant about knowing Mr. Dempsey and Chloe’s situation. Mr. Dempsey did not divulge information but did sign the paperwork as neither parent nor guardian allowing Chloe to play in the bouncy house.
Chloe rode the appropriate sized rides. Mr. Dempsey smiled and waved to her, as she passed him watching her. Mr. Dempsey and Chloe shared a corndog. Chloe went through the home fire escape exhibit. As Chloe emerged from the mock room filled with imitation smoke, Mr. Dempsey cheered her on to find the mailbox, which was the safe location outside a burning home. They laughed and smiled.
As we made our way through the exhibits and rides, one of the children who came to the fair with Melissa approached Mr. Dempsey in tears and appeared very upset stating that they had lost the two-year-old child. Mr. Dempsey tried to comfort the child asking her what she was talking about. When the child explained they could not find the two-year-old child. Mr.
 
Dempsey tried to settle the child down by stating it would be okay they would find her. During this conversation, a woman approached the child and stated the two year old was currently at the fire department exhibit. Melissa then approached and the woman informed her where the child was located. Mr. Dempsey then told the child everything was okay they had found the two year old. Melissa and the child parted way with us.
With only a few minutes left to visit, Chloe wanted to ride the bumper cars with Mr. Dempsey one last time. Melissa and the children approached us. The children began to tell Mr. Dempsey about their items they had purchased at the fair. Mr. Dempsey politely explained they only had a few minutes left and Chloe wanted to ride the bumper cars again. Mr. Dempsey excused himself and we went to the bumper cars. They rode the bumper cars again in separate
cars.

As we made our way toward the exit, Chloe expressed she did not want to leave Mr. Dempsey. Mr. Dempsey reassured Chloe he would see her on Saturday. As we were walking out, Melissa was waiting at the exit area to the parking lot. Melissa explained that she was waiting for the Maternal Grandmother to pick them up and that she would take Chloe. I walked with Mr. Dempsey, his mother and Chloe out to the parking lot. Chloe then went with Melissa and the other children to meet the Maternal Grandmother while Mr. Dempsey and his mother made their way to their vehicle. Melissa and Mr. Dempsey hugged before leaving.
As I left the parking area, Melissa was waiting for the Maternal Grandmother at the parking area entrance it was after 2:45 pm.

This visit was held at Howard’s home the uncle of Mr. Dempsey. Howard was present during the visit.
I met Chloe and maternal grandmother in front of the house. Mr. Dempsey met Chloe and me at the front door where they greeted each other with smiles and hugs. Chloe brought Mr. Dempsey a lollipop. Mr. Dempsey was very thankful. Mr. Dempsey and Chloe started to put together a puzzle of the USA that Howard had brought for Chloe. Mr. Dempsey suggested they could go to a park nearby but it would take 30 minutes to walk to the park. Mr. Dempsey explained they would have to go sooner than later because of the time constraints. Howard said
it was a nice park to play. Chloe said she wanted to go to the beach first then the park. Mr. Dempsey reminded her of time constraint. Chloe decided the beach was where she wanted to play. Mr. Dempsey brought snacks and we went to the beach.
At the beach, they played imaginary games and play. Mr. Dempsey allowed Chloe to set the pace and the criteria of the game and imaginary play. As they played, Mr. Dempsey and Chloe laughed, smiled, and engaged in conversation. Chloe and Mr. Dempsey make eye contact
 
and use normal tones of voice when speaking to each other. Mr. Dempsey encourages Chloe’s imagination and creativity.
While on the beach, Chloe threw a piece of wood at the Canadian Geese. Mr. Dempsey instructed her not to throw things at the geese but added that she could chase them. Chloe threw the wood again and Mr. Dempsey said in a stern voice “Did you hear me? You can chase them but do not throw things at them.” Chloe put down the wood and started chasing the geese. Afterward Mr. Dempsey asked if she like chasing them and if chasing them was fun. Chloe answered yes. During the visit, Chloe referred to Mr. Dempsey as John more often than dad or
daddy.

At approximately 5:00pm, Mr. Dempsey was swinging on the hammock and Chloe was standing nearby as they played. The log in which the hammock was attached to came loose and it fell hitting Mr. Dempsey in the head. Mr. Dempsey needed medical attention. Chloe became upset and I intervened to calm her down. I told her everything would be okay and that she needed to focus on what I was telling her. As Mr. Dempsey made his way to the house, I had Chloe gather her shoes and sweater and we followed. Howard was not at the beach with us, but
came to the stairway as we were approaching the property. Mr. Dempsey and I asked Howard to call an ambulance. We arrived at the house while Mr. Howard was calling an ambulance. Mr. Dempsey sat on a bench outside the front door. I took Chloe to the side of the home where she brushed the sand off her and put her shoes on. I explained to Chloe that everything would be fine.  I called the CFS emergency phone and Christine immediately answered. I explained the situation and asked that the maternal grandmother be contacted to pick up Chloe. Christine called me right back stating maternal grandmother was in route.
I calmed Chloe down for a few minutes then took her to Mr. Dempsey. I explained to Mr. Dempsey the maternal grandmother was on her way to pick up Chloe. Mr. Dempsey and Chloe said goodbye. Mr. Dempsey reassured Chloe he would be okay and although it looked "yucky", it was not that bad. Chloe received this information and remained calm. I took Chloe to the front of the house, where we waited for maternal grandmother. The ambulance came and Chloe informed the emergency crew that John would be needing stitches. Chloe and I played cards until maternal grandmother arrived. Maternal grandmother asked Chloe if she was okay and said she was glad Chloe did not get hurt. Maternal grandmother asked if John was okay.
Chloe said yes he needed stitches because he had a cut on his head. Maternal grandmother asked
 
if Chloe was able to say goodbye to John. Chloe said yes. We then parted ways.

This visit was held at Howard’s home (Mr. Dempsey’s uncle).

I met the maternal grandmother and Chloe in front of the home. Chloe asked me to carry one of her toys. Maternal grandmother gave her the option of take only one toy or none. Chloe persisted in taking both. When the maternal grandmother did not concede, Chloe commented
she did not want to attend the visit. Maternal grandmother explained to Chloe that she could not change the visit, as this was John’s four-hour visit. Chloe finally agreed and took the animated puppy. Maternal grandmother told Chloe that was a good choice and John would probably like to see her puppy.
I took Chloe to the front door where Mr. Dempsey met us. Chloe was excited to see John and began telling him about the animated puppy she had brought to the visit. Mr. Dempsey listened to Chloe and responded with interest. Mr. Dempsey and Chloe played with the animated puppy in the living room. Chloe then wanted to play at the beach. Mr. Dempsey, Chloe, and I went to the beach. Mr. Dempsey and Chloe played for hours in the sand and water. Mr. Dempsey then suggested we return to the house, as he did not want her to become dehydrated. They ate ice cream and drank water. Mr. Dempsey asked Chloe if she wanted to towel off and dry outside as she was covered in sand. Chloe wanted to use the garden hose to spray off the
 
sand. As Mr. Dempsey was helping Chloe spray off she wanted to use the hose herself. Mr. Dempsey allowed Chloe to hose off the sand. As Chloe sprayed herself, her pants began to slide down but her underwear stayed on. Mr. Dempsey asked Chloe to pull up her pants, however; she did not. She continued to spray herself with the hose and her pants fell to her knees. Mr. Dempsey asked Chloe to pull up her pants again, she ignored his request. Mr. Dempsey tuned
his back toward her and in an assertive voice demanded she pull up her pants. Chloe pulled up her pants. We walked back to the side of the house so she could dry off with the towel and sit in the sun to dry. Mr. Dempsey stepped in the doorway to get water and I was standing in between him and Chloe. Chloe then let her pants fall down again. I then told Chloe to pull up her pants.
I explained to her that John had asked her several times and this was inappropriate behavior and I was only going to ask her one time. Chloe pulled up her pants and did not display this behavior the remainder of the visit.
Mr. Dempsey, Chloe, and Howard looked at books about seashells and compared them to shells Howard has in a display case. While they were studying the shells, Chloe made a
comment about beating someone’s ass. Mr. Dempsey looked at Chloe with disapproval and

Chloe did not continue the behavior. Mr. Dempsey and Chloe played chess together.

During the visit, Chloe made inappropriate remarks using curse words. Each time Mr. Dempsey would meet her with a disapproving look or comment and Chloe would discontinue the behavior. Chloe addressed Mr. Dempsey as daddy the majority of the visit. Chloe
spontaneously tells Mr. Dempsey she loves him, and he replies that he loves her. Chloe engages with Mr. Dempsey continually and he continually stays involved in conversation and play with her. Chloe did not play long by herself, she would migrate quickly back to Mr. Dempsey and they would play or converse. Chloe received a little blister on her heel. Mr. Dempsey cleaned the wound and put a bandage on the wound.

This visit was held at Howard’s home (Mr. Dempsey’s uncle).

I met the maternal grandmother and Chloe outside the home. Chloe and I met Mr. Dempsey at the front door where she gave him a piece of her birthday cake and a flower. Chloe explained to Mr. Dempsey that she brought the cake and flower because he could not attend her birthday party the day before. Mr. Dempsey was accepted her gifts and thanked her. Chloe acted very excited to see Mr. Dempsey smiling and hugging him. Mr. Dempsey hugged her in return. Chloe was excited to see Howard, Mr. Dempsey’s uncle. Howard gave Chloe her birthday gifts. Mr. Dempsey brought Chloe her little pink pony from his home.
During this visit Mr. Dempsey, Chloe, Howard, and I explored the beach, fed the pony and goat. Chloe and Mr. Dempsey drew pictures in her art book, played with a horn, and played badminton in the living room. Mr. Dempsey’s 13-year-old niece arrived at approximately noon while we were walking the beach. Mr. Dempsey and the two children played in the sand.
During the visit, Chloe never ventured far from Mr. Dempsey. Chloe would play with the other child and engage in conversation with Howard but always included Mr. Dempsey. Chloe would take instruction from Mr. Dempsey without hesitation except at the end of the visit.
 
When Mr. Dempsey asked Chloe to help gather her belongings and put on her shoes, Chloe acted as though she was hesitant. She did not respond as she did during the visit when given
instruction or asked to perform a task.

Chloe found a starfish while exploring the beach. Mr. Dempsey and Howard encouraged her and gave helpful advice on how to remove it from the rock. After removing the starfish, she wanted to keep it. She carried the starfish for a while. Mr. Dempsey explained to Chloe that if she kept the starfish it would not live. He explained the starfish needed salt water and food. Mr. Dempsey asked Chloe if she wanted to put the starfish back in the water so it may live. Chloe was hesitant about her decision. She wanted to keep it but she did not want the starfish to expire. Mr. Dempsey told Chloe it was ultimately her decision but he encouraged her to put it back in
the water. Chloe decided to release the starfish. She was saddened after releasing the starfish and immediately sought comfort from Mr. Dempsey. As Chloe hugged Mr. Dempsey, he was reassuring of her decision. He said her decision was good and that it was okay to be sad. He comforted her by saying he understood she had found a friend in the starfish but now the starfish could live.
Chloe engaged in conversation and play with Mr. Dempsey during the entire visit. She engaged with others sporadically but mainly focuses on Mr. Dempsey. Mr. Dempsey allows Chloe to venture and play but never allows her to go far. Mr. Dempsey allows Chloe to set the pace of the visit for the most part. Mr. Dempsey engages with Chloe and initiates conversation.
At the end of the visit, Mr. Dempsey helped Chloe gather her belongings. He hugged her and said goodbye. Chloe hugged Mr. Dempsey saying goodbye. Chloe said goodbye to the others and we walked to the front of the house. The neighbor was trying to get a moving truck out of the narrow roadway. They had asked the maternal grandmother to leave to allow them to leave. I waited several minutes for the truck to leave the roadway so the maternal grandmother could return. After 10 minutes, the truck had not crossed the small bridge and the maternal grandmother had arrived. I walked Chloe down the roadway, crossed the bridge, and reunited
her with the maternal grandmother. The maternal grandmother asked if there were more than three people at the visit. I assured her there were only three people at the visit.

There was a little confusion as to the meeting location. The instructions were to meet at North “I” and Division. However, the coffee shop Mr. Dempsey was waiting at is located at South “I” and Division. I met the maternal grandmother and child at the corner of South “I” and Division a few minutes after 4 pm. Soon after maternal grandmother left the area, Mr. Dempsey appeared and crossed the street to meet us.
Chloe was very excited to see Mr. Dempsey. They both greeted with smiles and hugs.

Mr. Dempsey brought Chloe’s bicycle, helmet, badminton set, and chalk. Chloe rode her bicycle through the park. Mr. Dempsey reminded her to wear a helmet, not to ride too far ahead, and to remain insight. Mr. Dempsey did have to remind and speak to Chloe concerning her riding off too far. Chloe appeared receptive to his instruction by shaking her head and verbally acknowledging the instruction.
Mr. Dempsey and Chloe drew pictures on the sidewalk. They held general conversation and Chloe drew what she identified as a lawyer. Chloe rode her bicycle through the water park area. Mr. Dempsey reminded Chloe not to get wet.
 
Mr. Dempsey and Chloe played badminton for a few minutes in the park. We walked to a local toy store where Mr. Dempsey gave Chloe a $20 budget for her birthday. Mr. Dempsey and Chloe worked together on purchasing toys and adding them up to make sure she did not exceed her budget. Afterward we went to yogurt shop across the street. They discussed the flavors and helped each other pick out flavors and toppings.
While sitting at the yogurt bar, Chloe stated that her new toys were sad they were mourning. Mr. Dempsey told Chloe it takes a while to feel better and that it will hurt for a while. This conversation was pertaining to the recent passing of Chloe’s mother. Chloe talked to Mr. Dempsey about death and sadness. Mr. Dempsey validated her feelings by saying it is normal to be sad and it will hurt for some time.
Throughout the two-hour visit, Chloe would randomly sit next to Mr. Dempsey putting her head on him. She would also randomly hug him. Mr. Dempsey was receptive each time. Chloe brought up living with Mr. Dempsey. Mr. Dempsey said he was grateful for the time he has had with her and that he was going to see her again on Saturday. Chloe said her maternal grandmother said Mr. Dempsey could not attend her birthday party. Mr. Dempsey said that was okay and that she needed to enjoy her birthday party. Chloe also brought up many past adventures they shared together, such as visiting the yogurt shop, shopping at the toy store and time they spent at the park.
We ended the visit at the coffee shop. Mr. Dempsey helped Chloe gather her new toys and belongings. They hugged and said good-bye. They both said they missed each other and confirmed they would see each other on Saturday. Chloe and I walked across the street and met the maternal grandmother.

Brief Outline of Visitation

This report is in reference to the supervised visitation between John Dempsey and a child, Chloe Murphy. John Dempsey is fic of kin not a biological family member to this child. Therefore, I will refer to John Dempsey as Mr. Dempsey or John throughout this report. This visit was held at residence of Howard Dempsey, John Dempsey’s uncle.
I met the maternal grandmother and child in front of the home. The maternal grandmother introduced me to the child and said goodbye. The child and I entered the walkway through the garage to the home where Mr. Dempsey met us outside the front door.
The child and Mr. Dempsey immediately hugged and said they missed each other. They sat on a bench next to each other outside the front door for several minutes hugging. We entered the home where Mr. Dempsey offered the child food and beverages. The child asked to go to the beach, Mr. Dempsey agreed. They gathered snacks and water and we walked down to the beach.
During the visit the child addressed Mr. Dempsey as daddy and John, alternating between the two. Mr. Dempsey answered to both John and daddy when the child addressed him. The child asked why she could not live with Mr. Dempsey. He responded that when her mother died rules changed but he was very glad they could be together on this day. The child told Mr. Dempsey when she was old enough to say where she wanted to live, and that she would choose with him and they would live in Seattle. Mr. Dempsey replied that was nice. The child stated
the maternal grandmother would not allow her to attend “Sparkle” (?). Mr. Dempsey said the
 
grandmother makes the rules now. The child asked Mr. Dempsey why she has not been able to see him. Mr. Dempsey said when her mother passed the rules changed. Several times during the visit, the child asked how much time they had left. Mr. Dempsey would give her the correct time they had left and would follow with the comment that he was glad he was able to spend time
with her today. Toward the end of the visit, Mr. Dempsey said they needed to go back to the house to prepare for her to leave. The child stated she thought she was able to spend the entire day with him. Mr. Dempsey said they had four hours together on this day. Mr. Dempsey told the child he would try to schedule something fun on their next visit such as a movie. The child asked Mr. Dempsey why he was mean to “Darren or Darrel”. Mr. Dempsey replied when her mother died he was sad. The child accepted Mr. Dempsey’s reply.
During the visit Mr. Dempsey and the child engaged in sand castle building, redirecting water flow with shovels in the sand, playing in the sand and feeding carrots to the goat and pony. Mr. Dempsey and child snacked throughout the visit on popcorn, fruit snacks, breakfast bars, juice, and water. They sat next to each other conversing on the beach and deck. Mr. Dempsey and child stated they were saddened by the mother’s passing. The child stated she would be spending time with a friend of her mother who has horses. The child stated the maternal grandmother said it would be good for her to get her mind off her mother's dying. Mr. Dempsey agreed it was good for her to occupy her time having fun.
Several times throughout the visit, the child would tell Mr. Dempsey that she loved and missed. Mr. Dempsey responded with same. The child hugged Mr. Dempsey several times throughout the visit while they were playing, talking, sitting or spontaneously. Mr. Dempsey returned the affection each time.
While at the pond, the child wanted to enter the water. Mr. Dempsey told her that was not a good idea. While walking to the beach we had to cross railroad tracks. Mr. Dempsey told the child to wait for him and not walk ahead.
At the end of the visit, Mr. Dempsey instructed the child to put her shoes on and gather her belongings. The child did not respond as readily to his requests as she had earlier when he would make requests of her. After the child was ready to leave, Mr. Dempsey and child hugged. The child and Mr. Dempsey said goodbye. The child put her head down and became very quiet as she left.
 
The child and I met the maternal grandmother out in front of the home where we exchange the child.
