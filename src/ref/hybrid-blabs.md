There was even an interesting time where I tried to accept Emily's choice of Donna over Darin. I couldn't do it. I had to do something to prevent Chloe from being raised by Donna. Obviously their skillfulness with fear-mongering and hysteria, and probably my laid-back nature didn't help. The city tried to chew me up. If a preponderance of evidence says I'm just too damn different, and Donna's actually Donna Reed, then fuck me with a 2x4. That's the whole dumb case in the whole dumb court. I'll stand for that verdict. Because it will also be made clear that Darin Murphy abused his daughter as she died.

I want to clarify I point that might seem confusing at first: From April to November, 2013, I tried to persuade Emily to specify Darin and Mariela as Chloe's guardians. I failed to persuade her. She knew her dad had serious emotional problems, and I just didn't see it from a distance. She said she had to go with her gut. She said Donna would do anything for Chloe. And she said, near November 12th, 2013, "If you don't like it, change it. Come to Tacoma, and be the guardian." When I accepted that offer a week later, it was Emily who had persuaded me. I had failed to persuade her. I said I would try ONE TIME and I did try. I failed, and changed to a position of supporting whatever she wants, as long as she wants it, until the day she changes her mind. I hope you consider this position to be the precise formula of unconditional love. I am deeply offended by the various spins used to make it sinister, but I'm used to feeling deeply offended by this family of jackels.

In her letter, Andrea Mattson asserts that a savage sex assault occurred either December 1st, or January 2nd. In her two calls to CPS, she asserts the assault took place January 1st. Ms. Mattson says she has a detailed scheduling method. Chloe and I arrived in Mexico on Christmas, and left Mexico on January 1st, during a ferocious rainstorm. All three dates are impossible. Is she my accusor?

My dialogue with Emily began in her hospital room in March, 2013. Quite a few turning points transpired, including lies that persuaded Emily that Donna was not trustworthy and Darin was scheming. I can recount the specific statements and events that made this clear to Emily. Let me know if you'd like to know exactly what was said to and by me and Emily in our interactions with Donna and Darin during these "early months" prior to November, 2013.

Chloe launched my change of heart when she asked me to "Write another story called 'Chloe and John : our future togEther'"

Candace Zygar claims Chloe is "nervous, etc" in my care, and that I am "a social reject". Now over 100 pages of visit reports contradict her first claim. On Facebook, where my life updates get 20+ "Likes", Candace has two Facebook friends. One is Darin Murphy. Why isn't Candace owning up to her declaration by appearing as a witness? Is Candace my accusor?

Chloe called me dad consistently from age 3 - 6. Only when placed in Donna's custody did she return to John, which she also used when she was 2.

"Grandma says Mom doesn't go to church because they took out the part of her brain that makes her want to go to church." - Feb or Mar 2014. This is the kind of "believe what I prefer to believe" thinking Donna specializes in. It is untrue and unfair.

Darin gave full support for adoption during November 2013 meeting.

Emily, Chloe and I enjoyed visiting Festival of Dance Improvisation (SFADI) in Capitol Hill, Seattle each Sunday, where we and other families developed movement awareness and trust in a bright studio with a mirror wall.
(I have been a member of this dance group for eleven years.) It is clearly absolutely foreign and frightening to Chloe that upon her mother's death, her interaction with me is heavily regulated and limited. She's accustumed to gymnastic activities with me. I've done my best to comply with CFS guidelines about contact, but my primary goal has been to meet Chloe's emotional need for reassurance in this difficult period. It's telling that this report contains a high number of reported violations of contact policy, all of which begin with Chloe approaching me. She clearly enjoys dancing and derives comfort and joy from the experience. This visit was not unusual in this respect. The only change is that Sarah chose to pile on every perceived violation of the policy. (Which only explicitly applies to lap-sitting.)

I did not, and do not, add any information beyond what Chloe says about her future plans. The quotation is incorrect. Chloe said she wanted to live in the same house, and I affirmed I would like that, too. I did not add "the same house"; it was in her original statement. I also strongly support her claims of independence, and her wishes for her adulthood. I have never suggested--not in all my life--what she might do when she's an adult, except attend college and establish a career. But when she asserts that freedom can be hers at a certain age, I hear a child longing for her choices to be in her control, and philosophically I have a tough time failing to validate that thinking.

"When I first got to grandmas I had nightmares. When I am old enough to choose where I live I will live with you in Seattle."

"You should get a job like Daniel (a child play psychotherapist) so you can help other kids. "
