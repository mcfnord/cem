**Subject:** regarding faggots\
\
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player\_profilepage&v=3\_2qvXfA85c
the kid on the left is kinda funny. not super-funny, but kinda. in my
head, i focus on people who i think are ineffectual, perhaps
deliberately so, and *occasionally* i will describe them in my head as
faggots. I will only rarely verbalize this. Like, "Faggots!" I am
politically gay. I also think the word "slut!" and hold the view that
(a) thinking words is not oppressive in itself, (b) faggots and sluts do
exist, and (c) some one who is ineffectual and is impeding me is a
faggot. They might also be a homosexual, but damn it, they are a faggot.
I have close gay friends who alerted me to sensitivity to the term.
People who would freak about the word are themselves faggots. I
apologize but I'm truly this judgemental. Anyone who judges me as
anti-gay is a stupid individual who doesn't know me.\

**Subject:** job summary\
\
i got a new job about a month ago. i got a title promotion to pw3,
because I earn \$5/hr more than the pw2's can pay. this title promotion
will help me earn higher pay in the future. all i have to do first is:
do this project previous staff failed to do, because it was too
complicated. in the middle of our current product there's a hole where
their work was supposed to appear. but it broke them. so myself and an
evangelical missionary from Alaska were called in. So far we are getting
along very well and operating as an effective duo. The department where
I work is, by Microsoft standards, a mess. By non-Microsoft standards
it's average. I work in Microsoft's newest facility, and it's an
impressive imagining of life at work. Well, my office is typical
Microsoft, but at lunch, I go to this bustling mall with great meals, a
bicycle salesman, a band, a bank, a store, a cafe, restaurants. It's
built around a water feature. The landscaping is very nice. There's a
soccer field. I'm going to miss it as in 2 weeks we relocate to
EASTGATE. Turns out the bus to my new office leaves 2 blocks from my
house. So the situation will suck, but by various tricks I will pound
through to January, and then perhaps quit, successful and spent.\

"The obvious conclusion from Stuxnet is that there isn't any clear

that anyone could make money from this, which makes criminal involvement
unlikely. If you look at the level of difficulty and complexity behind
Stuxnet, it has to be a government effort."\

**Subject:** Fucking evening of shit.\
\
I had to write a nasty email. But I feel better about the situation now.
I'm just really angry at my agency about some shit they pulled 3 years
ago, and some shit they pulled today dredged it all up. I read them the
fucking act, and then told them to keep this shit out of my work email
account, because their shit and the issues they raise pisses me way the
fuck off. I don't think they expected it when they made their petty
demands. Alas, of course, there's pathetic backpedalling and minutae and
bullshit policy fighting in my future. But at least I told them how full
of shit they are, and how much they owe me a huge apology. It didn't
come 3 years ago. It hasn't come this time either. At least they know
what they are now. Cuz I spelled it out. And that's going to help them
in the future. I bet it will. GOTTA SLEEP\

**Subject:** I KEEP MY OWN ADA RIGHT HERE UP MY ASS HOLE\
\
Hi, Carin. Did Sara call you about my workstation requirements? Please
refer all questions about my workstation requirements/medical need
accommodations to me personally. Hi John, Yes, she did. I told her that
your workstation requirements are an ergonomic requirement and she tells
me that she will find space at Advanta to accommodate. I will include
you if there is further correspondence but will need remain in the loop
as a representative of your employer as well. I will be your rep when
the team moves to Advanta. Please let me know if you have additional
questions or concerns. Thank you! Carin Hi, Carin. When contacted about
any ADA matter, I want Aquent to (1) instruct the client to contact me
directly to offer me options. Then (2) immediately contact me directly
to summarize the contact. What is Aquent's general policy in this
scenario? (3) Do you ever discuss ADA matters with clients without
notification of the employee? Accomodation is unique to the individual,
because disability is personal, so I ask you to question how looping the
employee out is ever accomodation in any effective form. What happened
today was poor decisionmaking caused by a lack of leadership. I fixed
the poor decision, but I have to ponder how to prevent it, too.
Regarding access to my discussions with Microsoft about this, three
years ago, Kelly demanded I dismantle an ergonomic workstation. She was
indifferent to my pleas for mercy and reconsideration. The email I sent
to the hiring manager about the incident was explosive, and the hiring
manager fixed the situation, and also told me not to send email like
that to an agency, because it would cause more problems. I concluded
that Kelly does not know her role, and I came to worry that maybe you
are also solely my employer's representative, and that your policy is
driven by deniability or CYA and not driven by the spirit of the ADA.
"but will need remain in the loop as a representative of your employer
as well." If the ADA creates a notification mandate between us, please
cite the specific code. All this anger I feel boils down to: I "looped
in" Kelly, she absolutely attacked my accomodation, and that caused a
huge amount of ill will between me and Aquent on this issue. And now you
claim needs regarding looping in? Show me a pattern of looping me in
first! And then we'll see about more trust and collaboration, ok? John
Hi John, I do understand your frustrations. We need to remain in the
loop because as your employer it is our responsibility to ensure that
your needs are met when possible. Since you are mentioning ADA in your
emails I need to connect you with Kim Potter from the Aquent HR
department. We want to make sure that we have the proper documentation
on file to ensure we collaborate with you and proactively advocate the
accommodation. What would be a good time for you to speak with Kim and
what number will she be able to reach you at? Thank you, Carin Refer
client to me to seek options (use that word), and notify me of the
contact. I also want to know Aquent's policy on any accomodation call,
such as the one you took. I will not provide additional information.
Thank you. John\

**Subject:** Arrived\
\
Tomorrow I get to work from home, with a kick ass hookup. I had this
sorta once but I sorta avoided it then because it can make me bonkers
fast. But with this job it's actual policy that Friday we do this. It
probably doubles as a flu pandemic strategy. I'm not going in to
internet work until ten fucking a m just like always. If you follow all
the email drama, here's the latest: Hello John, My name is Kim Potter
and I am the Director of Human Resources at Aquent, based out of Boston,
MA. I am your representative from HQ and here to assist you in any way I
can. I am also here to walk you through this process. Aquent's policy on
an employee requesting an accomodation is quite simple: you request if
of Carin or myself. I work with the managers to see if we can meet your
request, to see if its reasonable for Aquent and the Client. The Client
is not your employer, Aquent is which is why this type of request must
come through me first. There are many laws that govern us through this
which is why if you do need an accommodation you must speak with me. I
can be reached via phone and email, and I will make myself available to
you at your time zone convenience. Please let me know when we can chat
so I can best understand your request and start work immediately at
evaluating it and moving forward. Thanks, Kim Potter Director Of HR
Aquent Hello, Kimberly. I've only requested an answer to this question:
When the **client** contacts Aquent regarding any accommodation, what
does Aquent do? You kind of answered, but your answer does not include
employee contact. I have serious criticisms of your stated policy on
business and legal grounds, but I've specified my own personal policy
and that will have to do for now. Contact me when client contacts you,
and we'll get along fine. John\

title and I made an amature move that made him look bad. His group has a
bad reputation. I AM NOT HERE TO PROTECT HIS REPUTATION. I'm here to fix

**Subject:** spell it out\
\
The Office has jumped the shark. It is sad. So I'm going back to work
tomorrow. Now I know that a guy with authority will rant at me if I do
something he doesn't like. But I also know he's a ranter, his department
has a reputation that he earned! And that freaks him out! The last thing
he can tolerate is moves that remind people of his department's
reputation (that they're sloppy). I have a larger view. What I did was
not a major incident. I was concerned about a major gap in our
documentation, and I asked some people who might know. I asked the
"proper" channel first and they ignored me. So I asked a lot more
people, on an alias. I've done this a dozen times before, and it works.
It was just the kind of thing that has made him look bad in the past.
Major conclusions: No, I'm not here for anyone's reputation but my own.
I'm here for the quality of the finished product, and I sometimes raise
hell for it. That can cause problems and ruffle feathers. Some people
accept this or even love it. Others freak out. He's a freaker. I am
currently in a rant war with the agency that represents me. That shit
will continue tomorrow on my home email. They are fucking idiots. Today
at the park on the garbage cans a sign notified me that the trash goes
to a landfill. But my agency can't notify me when contacted. They have
to go down. Somewhere in hell there's a place for pantsuit cake-on
robots running agencies and wasting my time. At work I have no intention
of stirring the pot at this time. Still, my judgement error was minor,
if there really was one, and his rant was over the top. He's kind of an
unusual person. He's intelligent, but he's a social dork. He's got a
large department. He's got persnickety rules. And when you break those
rules, he's got a stern condemnation. I can cope with all of that so
far. But respect it? No. It doesn't represent leadership to me. He
hasn't shown leadership to me. And I wonder how my own boss, who I
followed here from a much better group, got mixed up with this guy. It
would be a cop out to say he's a failure and I don't have to listen to
him. But just how I should listen is still unclear. My allegiance is to
her, and so far he has earned none from me. I like being greeted by the
boss. I like guidance about proper procedure when I don't follow it,
with a positive voice rather than a negative one. It's not like I did it
twice. But I am allegedly some bigshot with an advanced job title and
for \$30/day more daily, I put up with high expectations. So the
outcome: Someone I don't respect tends to yell and demean his staff. In
the earlier incident, he demeaned everyone on his contract staff. I want
to organize them to resist. But that's not my job. At some point he
might learn or realize that he doesn't have my respect. But realizing I
can basically think and say the guy's a screwup is helpful. It's
possible to say the right thing in the wrong way, and he's some kind of
expert at it. Then a part of me thinks: How could this be? How could he
be a screwup? Answer: He's not a total screwup at all. He's just got
some problems communicating. And if he wants to act like Rob Glaser (a
notoriously mean employer), I can respond with the street. I mean, it's
my view the guy is a dork with a long career who has carved a niche of
dysfunctional employment relationships. And who is one of his big
agencies? That asshole I fired in 2007, of course! My singular goal for
this entire week is to get a plan approved to publish by Friday, and
then publish. And if I have to fuck around with all these retards
instead, that'll be a problem. If I decide to earn \$30/day less, I have
a lot of job options with much easier commutes. I'm facing challenges,
but if any of them are of the People Should Quit Cuz They're Toxic And
Indifferent variety, then I will go. YOU BET I WILL. There is ZERO
reason to lock in to demeaning patterns. My phone rings every day and
the leads are real.\

Wood-burning sauna heater: \$540 Gas-burning sauna heater: \$2,000
Wood-burning would reduce my air quality. Seriously though what's the
big idea. Some safety bullshit probably.\

**Subject:** This is a real journal update\
\
What I did today: Went to Solstice and read *New Yorker*. Went to the
YMCA and worked out in the sauna. Bucket-washed some towels. Thought
about drilling holes to add a hot water line to the porch. Thought about
getting the moldy couch off the deck. Talked to Mike about the SAT, and
how I could move to SF. At 10pm, rode up 45th and across Aurora Bridge
to the Westin, where I briefly graced the Democrat party. Took a bus
home, where I watched a documentary about Harry Niellson, a songwriter.
I got fired from my job last week. A cautionary tale. I went to help
someone I'd helped before, but she had this new boss, who is a creep.
And the lesson is, perhaps, that I don't like creeps at work. I think
they need to grow up and learn to be polite and thoughtful. I will
resist a creep and take a creep to charm school / out behind the barn
because creeps in the workplace interfere with work and success in the
workplace. So apparently I'm spoiled. In the last job I faced major
problems but the attitudes of the leadership wasn't one. If management
does not step up to me and say, "Welcome, thank you for coming," then it
doesn't make any damn sense because when I hire anyone at all to come to
my home to do work I say something like, "Welcome, thank you for
coming," and I don't want to be a part of business that poo-poo's all
those niceties and treats people like machines. Treating people like
machines is an occasional pattern in software careers, because computers
attract control freaks. The state will probably send me biscuits,
because when you're fired by a client, it's more like the client saying,
"We don't need this guy" and so they lay you off. It seems like a class
privilege glitch in my favor. So I'm home. And when I'm home, I clean.
Big strokes! I just finished a huge clean-out months ago but I want a
push that simplifies my life. I don't know how long I'll stay here, as
Harry's style is static and kinda messy, and I'm just paying more than I
wish (\~\$880/mo). I'm throwing out the moldy couch. It lives outside
and won't survive another winter. I also plan to sell the big beanbag,
because it's just too damn big, and makes me sneeze. I'm doing a job
search. I don't just mooch. I get credible leads all the time, and know
one of them eventually crawls up my leg into my life. I'm wondering if I
could score something in San Francisco, just as a change. The jobs there
seem kinda rock-starry, like being technical writer for Twitter. Not
sure where my career is going because fundamentally I let it go its own
way, following the crossover between my skills and the needs of people
willing to spend. I do have real work as a writer: I'm helping Mike
prepare his personal statement for Berkeley. His scores won't be stellar
so the personal statement is his only ticket. I'm living on apples. I
went through this big process of determining which food helps life now
and later, and now I insist on buying these superfood staples first and
foremost. Meanwhile, Harry brought home some very tasty chips and shared
some. So tasty. I don't buy tasty chips like those. No, I live on apples
and spinach salad. Last week, a Brazilian spent \$35 at the movies and
\$25 ad McDonalds using my debit card credentials. So I'm waiting on the
replacement, and subsisting on about \$17 cash until it arrives. I
always want spending discipline as a religion when I'm unemployed, so
it's a good exercise. My code is weak, adoption is nonexistent, and new
ideas are untested. I'm soldiering on slowly. It was all so intoxicating
when I had fans. Mostly I mark time by reading *New Yorker* articles.\

**Subject:** coding yap\
\
kinda pleased whenever i get a few hours of coding done. it could be the
4th time i've implemented this basic functionality, which i call radar,
which tells you who your friends are adding. if it works, it'll be the
fastest implementation. it should be fast enough to serve anyone who
wants it. all previous implementations were too slow. it has been such a
slog. now i face the delicate final steps of determining whether and how
to publish information. so much of this is about data volume. of course
that was Big Lesson \#1, and it still is. if the code speed is too slow
or data volume too huge, then you don't have something thousands can
enjoy. as a test case i've specified my test group as every active lj
that reads this lj. sighmaster. all around. just tired and bummed
today.\

adding. This might help you maintain your LJ! This is brand new code and
I mention some issues. The quality of this product should improve as I
sample more over time, but this looks pretty good already. DOES ANYTHING

select distinct(watcher) from watches where watched IN (select actor

**Subject:** a real update\
\
Back in the day, I used to update this LJ with all my goings on. I kinda
quit that and can't get back to it. There are reasons. I don't feel like
I used to feel. I don't care like I used to care. Rather than youthful
hope, I've taken on adult cynicism. Which is balls. Youth is all about
wanting. Adults let go of wanting by realizing dreams don't always come
true, and in fact often don't. Buddhists don't think this way, right?
No, Buddhists come to no such conclusion. Rather, they let go of the
desire of dreams, but draw no conclusion about futility and doom. Right?
And what would an update say? I've got free time because I was let go
from my last job after one month. I've been meaning to mention it. I
don't think cynicism was the problem on that job. Briefly, I went to
work for someone I'd worked for before. She has a new boss now. He's a
major dick, and I wouldn't put up with his shit, so he sent me home.
Aside from having generated lots of aggressive focus for the job, and
feeling frustrated that ultimately I won't be able to carry it out, I
think it's kind of funny, and kind of informative. I won't work for
creepers, at any price, and the older I get, the clearer this becomes.
Which brings me to life. Tomorrow is Emily's birthday. She was my
girlfriend, but we've been on the ropes. We're on the ropes because I
can't see marrying her, and things can't just stay the way they are. We
still meet up and have fun together, but there's more gloom to it. And
her daughter Chloe makes me very happy. But now it's not so clear how or
why Chloe will spend time with me, save when I visit Tacoma, where she
lives. Her house is dusty so I can't spend time there. It's a recipe for
more sadness and cynicism. Out of work, living through each week, it
gets so quiet here, and I miss her. I've seen them both every weekend
for at least 18 months. Each weekend now seems like it could be the
last. I always told myself Emily and Chloe are gifts of fate. When you
meet someone and plan a family, one could call that the classical model,
but this was not like that. And so the mismatched details didn't matter.
Details don't matter with fate. You can't choose your fate, so screw the
details, right? If or when I find someone new, Emily will feel hurt. And
maybe she won't have any inclination to keep Chloe and me together. So I
get to lose. If the gain was fate, the loss is, too. I can't pick and
choose. And as for dating, or meeting anyone, I'm dreadful at it, and
anyway after all we live in Software Engineerville, aka successful dude
central. So I will be alone again. Believe it or not, I accept this much
without feeling cynical. I'll go on a date or two with someone, but odds
are they won't suit me. Emily will feel hurt and not wish to bring
Chloe, and I won't be able to visit, certainly not the way they both
visit me here, because I'm asthmatic, and so I'll be alone and lose them
both, and no one will replace them. Which is why I figure I may as well
move to San Francisco. I'm looking for a place to live March through May
when allergies destroy me here. I don't know if this is the year or SF
is the city. I know I'm lazy and I know this plan sounds like work.
Staying and getting sick alone is probably what will happen again.
Strangely it only makes me a little sad. Like I said it's fate and fate
has as many ups as downs, right? Ups and downs are a package deal.\

**Subject:** LINQ\
\
I'm getting the hang of LINQ but there's a long way to go.

List&lt;HashSet&lt;Int32&gt;&gt; actors = new
List&lt;HashSet&lt;int&gt;&gt;(); List&lt;HashSet&lt;Int32&gt;&gt;
targets = new List&lt;HashSet&lt;int&gt;&gt;(); var sortedGroups = from
g in everyTarget orderby g.Value.Count descending select g; // fold the
sorted groups into the two dictionaries. foreach (var thisG in
sortedGroups) { // well, if these actors are already in my actor list,
then we skip foreach (var existing in actors) { if
(thisG.Value.SetEquals(existing)) goto ALREADY; } // i know its key, so
i can look for equal sets that aren't it. var sameActors = from x in
everyTarget where (x.Key != thisG.Key && x.Value.SetEquals(thisG.Value))
// so same actors, different key, so excludes thisG! select x; // All of
them are added as a single 'entry' actors.Add(thisG.Value);
HashSet&lt;Int32&gt; targs = new HashSet&lt;int&gt;();
targs.Add(thisG.Key); foreach (var same in sameActors)
targs.Add(same.Key); targets.Add(targs); ALREADY: ; }

analysis: this is 2nd grade LINQ, and I get a C+ on it. I just have to
learn new tricks, and it's been slow. it's like there was this painfully
shitty way to do all this shit, and i got really good at it. foreach and
ArrayList were my best friends, great innovations for the time. and then
generic collections, which I think I grasp and apply very well, and now
LINQ, which requires that i learn much better ways to do the same shit.
and if i make the transition, i will be a golden god. if i stick with
the crap i know, i'll be lost forever.\

"As for what happens to the complex, I have been quite firm that I will
not donate it or sell it, since the government has decided it is
illegal. The government actually wants to buy it from me, but I have
invested eight million yuan and [*the government has not explained to me

I think that's a poor sentence. They're down for maintenance and it will

some contractual definition or agreement regarding windows. Maybe
because it's a window you're more comfortable with it, or are on notice
that further windows are coming. Watch out for windows! Maintenance
apparently accompanies them! 2010... do you really need to mention the

I've whipped the recruiters into a lather, and it's time to start
calling them back. But really I know how these things go: I get the
right call, and I'm just IN baby. It just happens; the right job appears
and whacks me in the head. My time off has been all-night hacking
sessions, some of them great, but lately things seem squishy and dreamy
and unreal. Today was a particularly depressing day. Today I got rid of
the couch that was on the porch. This cost me \$55. Oh what the fuck
ever. It's gone. It was rotting. The giant beanbag is left. I laid in it
today and watched a movie. It's cozy. But it's so damned large, it
dominates the livingroom. So it's gotta go, right? I want one that's
half the size, something I can stow into the corner. Or something more
like a hammock, not a big bad blob of matter. I just can't have an
enormous beanbag dominating the entire space. The deck looks really sad
without the couch. But I can find some way to fix it. I'll find some
mini-hammock or wicker chair. It's all part of my "loose ends" schtick.
If I want to leave this place, I have to take care of the rotting couch,
and the big bean bag. I have to patch some holes I put into the walls.
Etc. I want the place ready for another roommate. Another roommate makes
stuff possible for me. I'm watching Hoarders. It freaks me out. This
morning I felt particularly grumpy/depressed. Could be three shots of
coffee last night. Or could be that I watched Hoarders. What a
super-depressing program! And just plain scary. Rachel and Harry went
with me for dinner and coffee. It was one of those days where that's the
best I could hope for. Then Rachel watched the documentary about Zachary
Bagby. Another super-depressing and scary media choice! I ditched an old
couch fair and square today. I passed discarded couches on the way.
Apparently many people don't discard their couches properly. Harry says
the vacuum broke down and has a missing part. :( I have to take it to
the guy on capitol hill to get it fixed. I'm also gonna get a water
injector cleaner. They're a must for carpeting! So first I have to fix
the vacuum I've got, before getting the steam cleaner. I'll get it done!
I like a clean carpet. Or rather, I hate a dirty one, with dust and
such. No way! I have a sort of process for keeping the house free of
junk and clutter. There's one entrance, so there's one exit. If I don't
want something, pushing it toward the door makes sense, right? And then
out the door, onto the deck, and then down the stairs. I've got hands
and they've got to migrate things out, out, out, even just a few feet,
even if I'm just not sure about discarding it. One quirky byproduct of
this is little piles, and I force myself to tackle them rather than
letting them languish in limbo. Sometimes that still happens; a pile
just sits rather than reaching the "final solution" and marching away. I
sometimes want a smaller bed, so I can live in a smaller space. I want
to be portable. But I always want a nice window with a nice view. I fell
in love with this cute room. Harry says there's lots of good places but
he really has no idea how hard it is to find a nice place at a good
price. I have some OCD traits, but I'm not a hoarder. I think
philosophically that discarding things that have a place in my memories
or heart is hard, but it's hard because letting go of life itself is
hard. Still, it's not optional, and so letting go of material things
shows maturity, as **soon enough I'll be expected to let go of my
life**. I wonder if a hoarder could think this way. It seems to say that
yes, absolutely, we'd like to hold on to everything, but in fact we can
keep nothing. So maybe hoarders need Buddhism? I kind of crave being the
opposite of a hoarder: having a small amount of small things I cherish
and adore. Getting rid of things is my way of asserting my love for
those things I keep. And the things I keep aren't hidden or boxed away.
They're all I have, because they're all I keep, and nothing covers them
up. Having finished a complete pass of everything I own just two months
ago, I'm considering another pass. All my passes follow a critical
philosophy: Don't focus on what to discard! Focus on what to keep! The
rest can be "taken care of" but I just have no idea how people sensibly
approach these monstrosity scenarios without saying, "Ok, all I really
truly want is this, this, and this." This angle is one argument I used
to convince Harry to leave his apartment of 12 years to move in with me.
And it worked: He took what matters to him, and trashed a whole bunch of
stuff by leaving it behind. I wish he'd do it again, even by changing
bedrooms, but he doesn't think this matters. Harry is OCD, but he's not
a hoarder, even though his room looks a little like these hoarders. He's
just OCD. A ten-year-old boy came to visit, and said Harry's room was
awesome. I don't see it! The place is a dump. But he is reasonably tidy
outside his room, so the whole plan is working ok. And he's great to
have around, as are his friends. He's a major reason why I like living
here. Living with a wierdo is hell, but living with a friend is cool,
cooler than living alone. Which makes me a little sad about my small
house, where I would live alone. That's a reason I want to expand it,
but that's kind of a pipe dream. I need about \$25,000 to do the job. I
think someone would have to be a significant other to share that home
with me. So my immediate plan is actually not to go back to the cabin,
but rather to go somewhere else entirely, probably in another city, for
a short time or a longer one. A short term relocation is an interesting
idea and challenge. But the finances of that revolve around having
another roommate. That's hard to accomplish. There's politics around
that, and risk. But there's lots of opportunity. The alternative is
being tied down where I am, and that idea sucks. It's weird because
really I have a nice home. The porch looks pretty lonely without
anything there. I bet the livingroom will look lonely without the
beanbag. I'll find something cozy but no-maintenance and small for the
porch where guests can sit, perhaps under blankets, in the spring's
first sunny days. **Update:** Now I'm watching Intervention. It's
brutal, but somehow easier to watch than Hoarders. And it puts my
addictions into into context. Really I just smoke marijuana and drink
coffee. But actually I vaporize the pot and stick to like one latte a
day. What kind of addict is that??? It's nowhere near the chaos of these
drugs. I'm so glad I stayed away from, you know, crack, morphine,
Vicadin, alcohol, blah blah. When I get more weed, I grind it up, cram
it in little plastic paint containers, and lock it in one of those lock
boxes housing agents use to keep the key under a combo lock. Emily and
Aaron have the combo, and I don't. All this is retarded and clever but
whatever. I would say my use of marijuana used to be much more severe. I
think this was because I had a lot of physical and emotional pain that
worked together to make me feel terrible all the time. A lot of things
got better since then, including yoga, extensive therapy, and lifestyle
changes. The people on this show need major hugs, I'm telling you.
Major! So far it's 4 young women. They say they're worthless. I used to
have a more negative self-image. I'm not even sure why. My therapists
say my youth was not normal. Once I realized I'm not normal, I embraced
it. There's nothing wrong with that much, *per se*. But it did represent
a recognition that I won't be or feel normal. People tell me I'm very
unusual which always makes me feel a little odd. I know it's true but
it's kind of meaningless. I do like to do things in different,
non-traditional ways. On some rating cards I rated super-high on
creativity, and have always been intelligent. I'm also bi-polar, which I
attribute to physical pain and other factors, which seems like its own
addiction. My doctor insists I'm not afflicted with bi-polar *illness*,
which is fortunate.\

i get so much song and dance from recruiters throwing darts at listings

without fanfare, someone with the title "Managing Director" writes
concisely: *Greetings John – I sourced your credentials on CB. We have a

Today wasn't a total effing waste. But I have cabin fever. I worked out.
That was timely. I vacuumed. I got the vacuum fixed yesterday. I cleaned
the house for my weekend guests. I suppose I should study my Spanish! My
guests are Mexican kids. I'll take them up the Space Needle. Maybe the
locks have cool fish to see? I did some laundry. Which means soaking in
a bucket on the porch. I read my last *New Yorker*! That's rock bottom!
I also read some of the Bukowski poems book I bought this week. I
optimized the radar code. Ugh, that code. It's a heavy burden! It's
either gonna be great, or I'm doomed. Or how about this fate: Bumbling

I didn't sleep well last night, and the night before that I had lemon
drops with Rachel and Harry. The morning after I drink alcohol, I feel
despair. Thank heavens I don't drink often! Not even once a month.
Anyway, with such rotten luck lately, I may as well keep expectations
low. I'm just trying to relax and amuse myself. I thought I placed an
order for a printer-scanner, but the order didn't go through. I've been
waiting for it! It's never coming! No billing on my credit card. So ok.
And my blind friend Bill just bought a new printer, and his old one
probably just needs some tinkering. Still, c'mon, I want color prints
and a color scanner, damn it. But if my friend has "free printer" maybe
that's a sign. It's laser and I do welcome the dot density. Harry showed
me where to get sunglasses at Goodwill. I had figured out how to find
the one pair at the drugstore for \$7, but \$7 at Goodwill can get *any*
pair. I've been having bummer headaches. I locked up my stash. That'll
help. This is one of those abbreviated weeks. The holiday will be nice.\

*2. Personal qualities of the applicant: leadership ability, character,
motivation , tenacity, initiative, originality , intellectual
independence, responsibility, insight, maturity, demonstrated concern
for others and for the community . Has the applicant challenged himself
academically and in other activities, and what is his success in meeting
such challenges? . 3. Likely contributions to the intellectual and
cultural vitality of the campus. admission officers seek diversity in
personal background and experience.* I was raised by Jehovah's
Witnesses. My parents never attended college, and encouraged me to grow
through advancing my position in the church. Six years ago, as a teen, I
had questions the church couldn't answer. Perhaps I asked too many
questions; my father let me go from the family plumbing business and I
was shunned from the closed community of the faith. I lost many friends.
A friend told me to do what I love, so I moved to Yosemite to practice
rock climbing in the valley. This was a time of rapid personal
transformation, and social rehabilitation. Between odd jobs in the
valley, I read works by Dostoevsky, Sartre, Camus, Kerouac, and others.
A machinist in high school, I found work for two years in the shipyards
of Port Townsend, Washington, before riding my bicycle to California to
work as a bicycle messenger. There was little opportunity in this dying
industry, so I returned to metal fabrication in Oakland, California. I
soon found acceptance within the West Oakland artisan community which
came to trust me and see me as a little brother, and invite me into
collaborations on their commercial and artistic endeavors. After taking
several jobs in fabrication, I began reading everything I could find
about building bicycle frames, and talking with everyone I met who knew
anything about it. A friend gave me an out-of-print technical manual
that described the different methods used by a handful of leading
bicycle frame builders. Working in spare time over six months in my tiny
room, I successfully fixed a frame for a girlfriend. I was hooked. Over
the last two years I have built a small business making and repairing
bicycle frames. I've developed creative, low-cost methods to produce
structurally sound, competitive bicycles. I designed and built a
two-wheeled bicycle that carries two half-barrels weighing 300 pounds.
It remains in daily use at a local brewery delivering beer. I
independently designed and fabricated a highly customized touring
bicycle for a little person (4' 3"), and am finishing a Dutch style
cargo bike she will use as a grocery transporter. I have made 4 custom
bicycles for Berkeley residents. In October, I was delighted to learn
that a bicycle I had made--a front-cargo "truck bike"--appeared on the
cover of COG magazine, an internationally distributed print publication
focused on the art and science of bicycle design. It is hard to make
bicycles profitably. To earn income, I have developed small fabrication
contracts, several involving patent-pending prototypes for start-up
companies. I designed and built specialized sporting equipment for a
paraplegic who plays a wheel chair sport called power soccer. I maintain
a fleet of Chinese style tricycles used by City Slicker Farms, an
innovative Oakland non-profit. They use the tricycles for urban 'green
transport' of fresh produce and compost. In addition to routine
mechanical maintenance, I often structurally modify these tricycles.
City Slicker Farms brings most of their other metal fabrication needs to
me. I am now part of a family of independent small business owners and
craftspeople in West Oakland. This tight-knit community survives through
micro-economics and mutual support; I've bartered training and bicycle
repairs for staples like fresh vegetables and clothes. I teach metal
bonding techniques in exchange for help with larger jobs. Many
fabrication companies have been wiped out by the recession. I've
survived by living within a disciplined budget that invests every penny
into my tiny shop, which is now professionally tooled, with over 3000
pounds of welding and machining equipment. Research and self-training
has been critical to my success so far. I actively study the advanced
equipment and exotic alloys I work with. I've studied the chemical
characteristics of the materials as they're exposed to great heat or
great pressure. I'm developing an intuitive understanding of these
materials and their limitations. This knowledge has been an asset to the
people who have brought their original designs to me. After 6 years in
shipyards, informal apprenticeships, and 2 years in my own shop, I am
beginning to think in larger figures and develop broader visions. For
example, what is the potential economic and social impact of affordable,
mass-produced cargo bicycles? I'm realizing the need to understand my
materials on a scientific level. A formal education is the fastest way
for me to advance in my career and impact. It is out of a desire to
expand my palette in the art, science, and cultural impact of metal
fabrication that I seek a classical education.\

Well I didn't do that. And I didn't know what would happen, and I didn't
want her to be totally confused. So that time I told her I'm John, and
not her dad.) Emily told Chloe all this because Emily isn't coming over

unusually serious, and said something about "I didn't know how I got

wish Emily wouldn't run Chloe through these revelations at 11:45pm, when
Emily herself is probably emotional about deciding to stop coming to see

classified documents has helped me as a citizen, and has strengthened
the nation. the checks and balances put in place by *NYT* and others is
crowdsourcing at its most responsible. and [*the principles behind the
leaks are sound, democratic
principles*](http://scearley.livejournal.com/2435565.html). sarah palin
calls this view "treason". she must go on to call *New York Times*
treasonists, and must call for their execution, because that's what we
do to treasonists, right? spies whatever. someone in power today (forgot
who) called the newspaper's relationship to the state some sort of
partnership. *NYT* invited the President to suggest suppression of
details, and the State Department encouraged *NYT* to share suppression
details with Wikileaks. I believe Wikileaks will honor this process. I
don't think it represents "partnership" with the state, so much as due
concern for the well-being of operatives and operations. The message is
that this publication does the nation damage. Few are saying it does the
nation a service. But I am saying that. Only Fox news would see their
role as one of partnership with the state. AND THEY DO: "Host Don Imus
asked Lieberman if thought *The New York Times* should be prosecuted for
reporting on secret State Department cables released by the
whistleblower website WikiLeaks." Host Don Imus called a top basketball
team of women "nappy-headed ho's". And Traitor Joe Lieberman needs to
get out of my caucus! **Update:** Here's some sense! [*The
Guardian*](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/nov/28/us-embassy-cables-wikileaks)
is also, as Sarah Palin would put it, a traitor! She would have executed
Daniel Ellsberg and let Vietnam last another 10 years! BELIEVE IT. **The
job of the media is not to protect power from embarrassment.**\

-   "So? Why should I give a shit? why should I care who my friends are
    adding?"

-   "Actually, it kinda confused me. I thought \*you\* were sending me a

European group Women Against Rape, have all made statements questioning
the nature and purpose of the prosecution. Klein: "R-pe is being used in
the \#Assange prosecution in the same way that women’s freedom was used

Sweet Sweetback. The internet was designed to withstand a nuclear war.

does it really matter? If Wikileaks is itself a kind of conspiracy then
only one nail has been pulled from the board. Will the network unravel?

that took entirely too long to set up but it works great. smart

which time no further WaitMyTurn calls will be welcomed. First run gets

**Subject:** Netflix streaming movie review: Brooklyn's Finest\
\
I just watched a movie called *Brooklyn's Finest*. It's got Don Cheadle,
and everyone loves him, and it's got Richard Gere. This movie is all
about hearing black vernacular and shooting black men. There's also a
white cop who keeps making babies and then frets about all the costs.
I'm surprised this movie is 2009, because for some dumb reason I figured
cliche' portrayals of urban black men went out in the '90's. Overall
it's a movie for people who like hearing swear words and black slang and
watching black actors get bloody and die. Don Cheadle rises above his
role, but how high could he go? **Bonus:** I also watched Wall Street
open, and gained \$120 during the movie. Everything's up. But let me get
this straight: Retail sales are stronger, so deleveraging is over? DON'T
BELIEVE IT. This rally is kind of due to devaluation of the dollar via
Quantitative Easing, or "Queasing". "Cheadle" and "Queasing" in same
post. I'm just trying to survive, dog. Yo. My LJ would be huge if I
spoke Russian. Also I decided that if I go back to Microsoft in any
limited-duration capacity, I'm going to consistently call myself "a

it wasn't as deadly hard as i had thought... i now have single-click
posting from ljmindmap to lj. this is because there's a new "repost"
feature added in june. so i use xml-rpc to post to , and then i set the
user up to repost that to their lj. so no copy-paste step. you can try
this: http://ljmindmap.com/h.php?n= (PUT YOUR LJ NAME AT THE END THERE)
on that page, you can post to LJ super-easy now. for my next trick, i
will gut and repopulate an f-list in real time in php, so you can see a
sample of the LJ's I'm recommending. This will probably be cool and
awesome. To me. I will use similar tech to populate , which will only
add LJ's that nobody's heard of, true loners. i've found a handful but
know the names of 65k more. a lot to sort through and mostly noise, but
i've found some cool lone lj's this way. THREE PRODUCTS FOR THE PEOPLE.

growing. this i can prove. nobody's using my products. but with the new
integration into LJ, they almost seem like LJ features. and I've hacked
through translation using google translate. and i'm just kinda waiting.
VERY much like trying to get an experimental airplane off the ground and

work well, occasional intrest doesn't cause lift. so i've been

I'm jealous of the time Emily has had with Chloe. I paid \$120 to pick

is jealous I'd do that (even though she was invited). I didn't want to
be alone. Emily had some other party to go to. Children evoke passion so
adults will meet their needs. I guess we can all feel jealous of that
love. Chloe spent the weekend confirming I'm Dad. We bonded a lot this
weekend. I showed her this video: This is Kyle, taking Chloe for her
first swim. Imagine you were born without your father around, but you
met me when you were about to turn 2, and I pushed you in a baby
carriage and spent all my time with you. This is a placid video. But I
am her dad. I don't want confusion. I've already confirmed he can't even
write her a letter, and I can. Some day she'll ask to see this film
again. But not yet. The day after Harry signed my new will, leaving
everything to Chloe, Emily said I had no commitment. That's because
Emily was mad. I don't mind when she gets mad. But I obviously have
commitment.\

subsequently enrolled at the University of Michigan, where he earned a
PhD in mathematics.\[9\] Kaczynski's specialty was a branch of complex
analysis known as geometric function theory. His professors at Michigan
were impressed with his intellect and drive. "He was an unusual person.
He was not like the other graduate students," said Peter Duren, one of
Kaczynski's math professors at Michigan. "He was much more focused about
his work. He had a drive to discover mathematical truth." "It is not
enough to say he was smart," said George Piranian, another of his
Michigan math professors. In fact, Kaczynski earned his Ph.D. with his
thesis entitled "Boundary Functions" by solving a problem\[13\] so
difficult that Piranian could not figure it out.\[14\] Maxwell Reade, a
retired math professor who served on Kaczynski's dissertation committee,
also commented on his thesis by noting, "I would guess that maybe 10 or
12 men in the country understood or appreciated it." The FBI theorized
that Kaczynski had a theme of nature, trees and wood in his crimes. He
often included bits of tree branch and bark in his bombs. Targets
selected included Percy **Wood**, Professor Leroy **Wood** Bearson and
Thomas **Moss**er. Crime writer Robert Graysmith noted "In the

**Subject:** cleaning\
\
I haven't had a job since Halloween.

-   I've been cleaning the hell out of everything. Sponges, bleach,
    Simple Green. I bought a carpet cleaner. I bought a Roomba. I got
    the vacuum fixed.

-   I've been fixing stuff. Nailing shingles to the steps so nobody
    slips. Gonna pay some guys to change my oil.

-   I now have a super-great document scanner. I've got Skype. I've got
    a video digitizer now. A kick-ass laptop is coming in the mail. It
    hasn't been some spending spree. Each purchase was super-cheap or
    super-critical.

-   Throw stuff out of my life. Shoes that make my toe hurt. Shirts I
    can't iron. Anything stinky. Throw it out.

-   Digitize videos from ten+ years ago.

-   Kill the rat. Got peanut butter for that plan. ;)

-   Spent a fuckload of time making it possible to fit a new roommate
    into the house.

-   Organize my ideas and plans much more deeply than usual.

-   At least I have a theory about what's wrong with my LJMindMap
    software. And the new features are cool.

Where's it all going? It's like I'm running around a tether ball post
faster and faster in hopes of gaining escape velocity. Escape to where?
To San Francisco? Redmond? (Some escape that would be. Ick.) Or just
lower my costs more and more, slowly disappearing, or just floating
away. Being light is a major theme. Nimble, organized. I'm trying like
hell to find a new occupant for my apartment, so I can buy a ticket to
San Francisco, where I want to help Mike with his project, and seek
work. In New York I found these smaller jobs that got me into the city.
SF must have something similar going on. SF is a medical test of the air
there in spring. can't be worse than here for my allergies. But finding
roommates is terribly slow right now. Like, zero. So I'm expanding the
reach of my marketing every day. The offer is very competitive, and
something's gonna give. But it might take too long... and until it
happens, I can't go to SF. And the longer I'm in Seattle, the closer the
Redmond empire comes to sucking me in. Which is already happening, so I
might have to embrace that fact. So I'm hustling like hell to have a
beautiful, rentable house here, and to reach people looking for one.
There's a selectivity problem once they get through the door--I am very
unsettled by the thought of any kind of douche having a key to my home
ever again. What I'm sorta saying is that I have some potential
outcomes, some I like more than others, and I'm advocating for what I
want. So I'm in a big fat marketing phase. The trick to marketing is
knowing what to ask for, where to ask, knowing what I'd accept, what I
must reject, and advocating most strongly for the outcomes I prefer. And
marketing takes time. So here I am. Lots of plans that rely on someone
else. One--cleaning--that doesn't.\

Chloe watched *Annie* with me. She hugged my head 6 times or so while I
half-slept through the movie. I will remember these days when life is
cold and I am so alone again. [*Loneliness is as bad for one's longevity
as smoking fifteen cigarettes a

sooner because I am alone. But at least there were days I was not alone
at all. i got a new computer. it's a laptop, and i chose it carefully. I
chose to pay for pixels, 1600x900. Super-wide is dorky and I wish it was
a portrait-mode device, but really whatever. It's like having two
screens side-by-side. I was getting pressure to have mobile computing
with Windows 7 so I could schlep around the Microsoft campus and they
can avoid expenses. And my old computer... what a champ it was for all
those years. I chose it cuz it's small. This one I chose cuz it's big.
Maybe it will last 5 years. Maybe I'll use it in a work setting. It does
seem like I have a lot of computers at this point. But the little, old
Dell is kind of sucking. Tooth cleaning tomorrow. Always a treat. I'm
sick. I think the worst is over. It has taken a toll on my sense of
balance. Like, I felt lazy, I felt stressed, I felt lost. Because I am
sick. But I ate better today, and worked out, and took some asthma meds.
Later I got a pizza, because I like a pizza when I'm sick. I feel kinda
goofed up. I'm hoping the virus passes and things start to seem ok
again. I'm making progress on all the shit I'm doing. I feel like a
loser these days.\

**Subject:** sweat equity\
\
When I don't have a job, I focus on lowering my costs. This plays out
like so: I have a spare bedroom, which I could rent to another roommate.
I clean the apartment deeply, with a focus on getting rid of anything
and everything, and then improve things. I didn't have a carpet steam
cleaner, so I got one this winter. A must for any asthmatic with
carpets. I have a cubby that called for a Roomba so I got one. I added
hook-rope contraptions outside to hoist and store a spare bicycle,
freeing up human-usable space. I installed shelving around high-use
areas like the bathroom vanity. I finished nailing shingles to the steps
so nobody will fall. I added locks outside so I can store items there. I
paid a guy to install some carpet I found, and fixed the lighting
outlets that were broken and dangerous, turning two scary, stinky
cubbies into fun places for playing and storing. I targeted the rat for
death and have a plan to end his visits. I innovate the shit out of our
breezy but basic top-floor house apartment. The goal is to raise the
value of the residence so finding roommates can be much easier. I've
made improvements costing hundreds, even though it's a rental. The rent
doesn't go up (and better not), but the value increases with every
innovation. This time I've been jobless for four months, and have had a
lot of time to devote to the place. I also worked on my car, and my
software, and bought a lot of little things like USB tools, and big
things like a pixel-pleasing laptop and a color document scanner. I
developed a strategy for capitalizing computer operations without
significant cost. This is obvious only in hindsight. I discarded 4
scanners and old computers at the drop-off point. They aren't in piles
in my closet. No way. I got rid of the couch on the porch. It was
rotting and growing mushrooms. I want to replace it with a
no-maintenance hammock-type solution. Haven't gotten there yet. I
constantly find good art for free or cheap, and make sure it gets shown.
The result is pretty nice. My apartment is cozy. There are usually many
low-cost ways to max out a place for comfort and utility. I do this for
properties I own, and for properties I rent. Lately I'm struggling with
the views and values of people I'm close to. My roommate has his own
strange views about the horror of improving a rental home's value. It's
hard to even begin to describe the chasm between us on this. He seems to
understand my views better now. And I got him to help clean with me. I
don't care if he thinks posters are "dust collectors", etc. Dusting is
simple. Would you rather live a sad life than dust??? So much of what
I'm doing here is simple, with such great results. I am sad that I feel
so alone in these challenges. But that must be an illusion. I can't
really be alone in wanting value for myself, for personal and financial
advantage. My roommate told the room applicant that I think everything
is mine. He thinks everything is not-his! So the commons is a car crash
and life is just a sad affair. Wanting to improve something is
part-and-parcel with feeling something is sub-optimal. You can't have
one without the other. I was disappointed that he said that stuff, but I
thought about it and yes, everything in my apartment that impacts me is
"mine" and can't be a pile of shit. What's the alternative? I guess I'm
troubled to realize I'm largely alone in my views about improving my own
life in my home. I'm surrounded by people who have internalized
low-class values, and live in destitution for it. I came to the 'hood
for an adventure but this discovery is a bummer. My neighbor below me
hustles in his own way, keeping his house in order. We're the most
responsible people on the block, which is kind of pathetic. But the
place is mine, hell or high water, and knowing it's supremely attractive
in this rental housing market makes me more comfortable that I can scale
up and back as needed, and even fully vacate temporarily with low cost
if suitable roommates can be found. So now I'm going back to work. I
offered the room to a guy who wanted it, but he backed out. I might
offer to one other lead, but might not. I know in just 3 months when
this job is done, I'll be ready to market again in the summer when this
place is a beautiful slam dunk. And I'll know I'm alone in my radical
view that improving the value of my home is a slam dunk made from cheap
parts and elbow grease. Maybe people are conserving their elbow grease.
For... ? Ayn Rand is basically right about all this, and her detractors
are basically disinclined to examine their own values, lest they
discover nobody else will make anything better, and we are all alone. I
think despite all my lazy impulses and hedonistic patterns, I'm a leader
on these matters and very few wish to join in. So I'm faced with the
leader's challenge: Motivate ordinary people to do extraordinary things.
Feel alone throughout, as people freak about the horror of improving
their own life in a rental property. Isn't that serving The Man's
interests? Well, don't you care about your own??? Pray for some success.
Know they're full of internalized oppression. Never waver to the
bullshit line about doom-by-tragic-commons in a shitpile world where
we're powerless. It's just fucking false, and it's the enemy of
progress.\

big shit i bought in my credit-fueled spending spree: 1. \$782 - NEW
LAPTOP, 1600x900 pixels or something like that! "COMMAND STATION" vs.
"LIL BUDDY" I had b4. 2. \$120 - to get Chloe for New Year's, making her
mom jealous and worsening my life. TOTALLY WORTH IT! 3. \$82 - Canon
PIXMA MX340 Wireless Office All-in-One Printer with color duplex
document scanning, which is as radically beautiful as i had hoped. TOTAL
BILL: \$1,746.31 - POW RIGHT IN THE NUTS. Some of that I got back in
cash from my guests. amortized the 0% payoff to conclude in Dec, 2011,
as the 0% dies after that. \$160/mo! Will destroy the card after first
paycheck arrives. And if I earn any 1099, I'll deduct items 1 & 3!\

I have to take the car in for an oil change. MODERN LIFE, BALLS TO YOU
AND YOUR GOINGS ON! I have always been a Bill Gates fanboy. Years ago, I
defended him against some jerks who said he's a selfish, rotten bastard
like all those other guys. Some people can't believe a rich guy could
give a shit. Well I still gaga over Bill. *"As I sit down to work on my
third annual letter, governments in every corner of the world are facing
tough decisions about how to reduce spending. Although foreign aid
accounts for less than 1 percent of governments’ total budgets, it is
one place being considered for cuts. As a result, health and
agricultural assistance that saves lives and puts poor countries on a
track for self-sufficiency is at risk. **The world’s poorest will not be
visiting government leaders to make their case, unlike other
constituencies**, so I want to help make their case by describing the
progress and the potential I see in key areas of health and development.
Perhaps it is ironic for someone who has been so lucky to talk about the
needs of those who have not. I believe **it is in the rich world’s
enlightened self-interest to continue investing in foreign aid**. If
societies can’t provide for people’s basic health, if they can’t feed
and educate people, then their populations and problems will grow and
the world will be a less stable place. Whether you believe it a moral
imperative or in the rich world’s enlightened self-interest, securing
the conditions that will lead to a healthy, prosperous future for
everyone is a goal I believe we all share."*\

So, if you had a pile of HTML, and you wanted to publish a revised pile
of HTML, what tool might you use? There's no meta-data about the HTML,
there's just the content. I could use straight HTML and CSS, and
approximate the output of AuthorIT, which they said they admired. (It
\*looked\* like AuthorIT output. I don't like how they expect color to
replace font size for higher headers.) What about indices and managing
hyperlink text changes? What's the simplest indexing and etc solution? I
could insert tokens and write a token parser, but I have to solve the
"publishability" and editing issues right and right away. Oh dear I
don't know... ha ha. Excel and Word, probably. I can't really get
AuthorIT, I'll solve this with Excel and Word, and port to HTML. I'll
bash in hierarchy. I truly want a wiki. Just a fucking wiki. Whatever
wiki shit they make me use at Microsoft, but one that manages titling.
That's half my problem solved. But what tool might you use? Homesite? I

**Subject:** ranty mcranterson\
\
I'm tracking some real loner LJ's:
http://ljloner.livejournal.com/friends At least three in there have that
"nobody's listening" vibe. When I stop smoking pot, I change. Which is
the same as saying I change when I smoke pot. First, to clarify, I don't
smoke pot if I can avoid it. I vaporize it, and then eat it. It's
better. Better for my lungs, a cleaner high, better for my sense of
well-being, everything. Everyone should vaporize and eat, and fuck
smoking! It's stupid! I'm officially against smoking pot! So about that
change. I get more ambitious. (The converse: Pot makes me less
ambitious. No astonishing breakthrough research there!) I think it's a
good time to get ambitious, which is like saying I feel stuck in a funk
and a rut. I moved into my current apartment after quitting for many
months. I kept analyzing my life, and the options, and eventually I
moved because it made sense. Living with other people has been a
struggle, but the struggle has eased since my long-time friend moved in.
The location has worked out well for me. Easy to get to the YMCA. My
room is cozy and my kitchen is great. The apartment is great. I did a
zillion things to make it great. Recently, until just now, I also quit
drinking lattes, and maybe that's wise. They seem to make my eyes itch!
Perhaps I'm allergic to the caffeine. But I've switched to green tea and
there's no itching with it. I want to stay off the latte's and treat it
similarly to the weed. Fuck my cravings, I get tea. I totally locked my
stash in a real estate keybox, and I don't have the combination. Emily
has it, and my neighbor has it as a backup. This works. I fiend for what
I can get to, but the rest is locked up. So my next thought is to lock
it all in the box during the work week. This might bring "the best of
both worlds" my way. In my opinion, I get insanely aggressive. Pot is
one way to tone it down and go with the flow. Lately I've felt "tired"
of people. People talking their smack. Like when I moved into the
apartment, and the landlord introduced me to his sleazy tactics. Or
people delivering the same old half-baked solutions. Or Harry leaving
dirty measuring cups by the sink, like little gifts. I know he won't
wash it until (a) he runs out of others, and (b) he needs a measuring
cup. If you think this through, you realize he's compelled to do the
same amount of cleaning (cuz he cleans when he needs one), so the debate
is about \*when\* to do it. Certainly not after preparing the meal.
Certainly not! I want to throw them out the window, which is right in
front of the sink. It's a sink with a nice bath of soapy, bleachy water.
Rinse your shit and throw it there. If it sits a week then I'll throw it
out the window. This is far-below-minimum for most women co-habitants,
and it's just good judgement in a sanitary world. So far Harry and I
have worked out most of our disagreements and things are reasonable.
He's no Nathan. Oh fuck that kid. So during this extended time off, I
bought some sensible shit, I fixed almost everything, including my car,
which has new oil, a new drain in the rear for the leaky window I made
from plexiglass, and new steering fluid. I kind of want to take it to
the next level with a safe and comfortable "ultra" driver's seat, but
this might never happen. As much as I like the junker look of this
25-year-old beauty, or is it 30, I want its engine to be great and I
want it to be as safe as possible. Apparently its struts are shot. I'm
ignoring this. My clothes are in good shape. And clean, too. With a hint
of Simple Green scent. I geared up on clothes during the fall. I think
I'm good in that department. But I'm getting sidetracked. The word I use
in my head is "savage". Like, in my new job, I'm going to struggle in
the first days to be calm. Because I know once the work is clear, I'm
going to rip it apart like a savage. And if fuckers get in my way, I
will summon all my calm to refrain from attacking them, yes, like a
savage. It turns out there are guys in high-tech who think they're a Big
Deal, and some of them like to talk tough, like that douche in the fall
who couldn't handle me. He would last about 2 seconds in a tit-pulling
contest at full Internet volume. So I was supposed to leave on the kid
gloves, even when he was clearly seeking a smackdown. And I reflected: I
get paid for hard situations. I don't get paid for \*crazy\* situations.
I showed him what a smackdown looks like, even delicately. And I was
sent home for 4 months of paid break. I DIDN'T MAKE THE SYSTEM. It seems
like I should embrace my loneliness while attacking it savagely. Few
know the tale of when I met KC. She was on my porch, admiring my real
estate. I invited her in and we played goofy games for an hour. That was
when I wasn't getting high. Later I returned to weed and she didn't like
my style anymore. HINT HINT In March, April, and May I'm going to get
sick from allergies. Pot is an inevitable balm during this period. And
this year I will start immunotherapy. It's totally for me but I just
wasn't aware of it. (Thanks shitty medical system.) And I'm saying that
at least at the moment, though I feel depressed, frustrated, and
aggressive, I'm glad the lock is on the stash, and I'm interested in
pushing this approach a bit further. I'm going to stay a technology
skeptic, but I'm kicking the latte habit, locking my stash, digging out
of my housing situation, and pressing the flesh in public. jsl32
explained that women want a house and 1.5 children, which means I can't
really bother or fret about women. We had a good run! Akiko called to
ask stupid tax questions and it reminded me how she'd never give up on
questions, even when it was upsetting to me, because I don't want to be
a tax advisor. And isn't that the whole experience: Computer Guy,
Busybox of World Events, Oh tell us More as we sit and listen. No, fuck
YOU. In a way I'm realizing I will be alone, at least as far as I can
see it, probably because I'm an obsessive neurotic narcissist without a
huge amount of money. And if that's the deal, then that's the deal. And
I'm saying I accept it, having few other options. It is a goal to marry
because doing it right is good for my health, which is probably more
narcissism but also science. I'm just tired of bullshit in my life so I
want to make some changes and try a new approach.\

**Subject:** my phone plan\
\
AT&T used to charge like \$50/mo. For YEARS. This made no damn sense. I
didn't buy data so WTF. I switched to the pay-as-go plan. The one that
interested me is \$3/day, but only on days that I use the phone. Once I
do, I can use it all I want on that day. So if I don't get any calls, or
make any calls, it's free! I can turn the phone off, for example, and
assure no costs accrue. Well that's all nice. What about text messages?
I can buy a package of up to 200 for use over one month. Pretty
standard. And texts don't trigger the \$3 charge! So for \$5/mo (the
cost of the 200 text messages), I can get and send texts. But how does
this plan really take off? I'll tell you! Pay-as-go maintains a prepaid
balance. When your balance gets low, and you make a call, you get run
through this song-and-dance about adding money to the account with a
credit card. And when your balance gets *really* low, under \$3, you
can't call out and nobody can call in. Which means I can leave the phone
on, still getting and sending texts, for \$5/mo! I started to think I
was on to something when AT&T started sending me these enthusiastic
texts about switching to \$2/day. But that plan triggered a \$2 cost
whenever a call **or a text** occurred. No thanks! So I texted back STOP
as directed. And here's another hint: Once you switch to the \$2/day
plan, you can't switch back! They must really hate what I'm doing! And I
started to think I'm really, *really* on to something when AT&T ignored
my opt-out and kept texting me this enthusiastic pitch. I texted back
STOP again. And they sent the pitch a THIRD time. So I send back STOP
and also called in. And the guy tried to convince me to switch a 4th
time, just like all the texts did, even though I was calling to report
the failure of his opt-out system to actually opt me out. I yelled at
him in that way I tend to do when people are playing games to my face.
When you start taking big corporations to the cleaners, their pleas for
mercy are so disguised but still you should feel flattered. So now when
Mike wants to reach me, he texts me to call, and I call on Skype. And
when someone calls my Google Voice \# and leaves voicemail, a
transcription of their message comes as a text message. And when I want
a mobile phone I can use all day long for \$3, I have that, too. From
\$50/mo to \$5/mo, just like I hoped. And obviously AT&T is kicking
itself for what it sold me.\

Feeling down today. When I quit smoking dope, I get more ambitious. But
it's probably more complicated than that. Maybe ambition requires
dissatisfaction, plus hope. So today I feel unhappy. Hopeful? Maybe I
have more capacity for hope. Marijuana, especially when smoked from a
bong, delivers a blow that I transcribe as, "I couldn't face my problems
if I tried. Give up." Which might be fine if you don't have problems to
face. Certainly we can't and shouldn't be facing down our problems *all
the time*. I've gotten high to escape pain, and to escape ambition. So
if I quit, and feel dissatisfied and dispirited, that sounds like my
lot. Ambition comes from dissatisfaction. I could mask dissatisfaction,
or accept it and respond to it. I also know a little practice makes
coping with dissatisfaction easier, and finding solutions gets easier,
too. So I'm bored and frustrated right now, but it's no big deal. It's
not despair or anything. Maybe that's the point.\

This is something, anyway. Two more days pass, and I start attacking

problem. But what about money? Can't I get PAID somehow? The DO-NOT-CALL
government site seems to require a normal phone number, and be for
normal phone calls. I found one confirmation of this, so opt-out with
SMS is voluntary. Still, they claim to have an opt-out within each
message, and it replies that I'm opted out. Every Two Days! And I don't
want to use AT&T's anti-spam filtering AGAINST AT&T. Does not seem like
I should have to. Oh, here's the way to go next:

- Al Jazeera published an opinion piece from Anonymous. I get so used to
associating Opinion with Wall Street Journal, which means SKIP THIS IT'S
ABSOLUTELY INSANE. But this is a whole new deal here: *... the greatest
threat to revolution comes not from any state but rather from those who
decry such revolutions without understanding them. In this case, the
idea that a loose network of people with shared values and varying skill
sets can provide substantial help to a population abroad is seen as
quixotic - or even unseemly - by many of those who have failed to
understand the past ten years, as well as those whose first instinct is
to attack a popular revolt rather than to assist it. Elsewhere, a number
of US pundits decided to criticise the revolution as possibly
destabilising the region; many of whom once **demanded the invasions of
Iraq and Afghanistan** - and greeted every Arab revolt as the work of
President Bush - but now see nothing for themselves in the cause of Arab
liberty. ... more must be done before the movement takes the next step
towards a worldwide network capable of perpetual engagement against
those who are comfortable with tyranny. Whatever effort is required,
such a goal is not only possible, but rather unambitious. There is a
reason, after all, that those of us who have seen the movement up close
have dedicated our lives to what it stands for, and have even **violated
the modern Western taboo of believing in something**. This is the
future, **whether one approves or not**, and the failure on the part of
governments and media alike to understand, and contend with the rapid
change now afoot, ought to remind everyone concerned why it is that this
movement is necessary in the first place.* **Updates:**

-   Anonymous may have knocked 3 web sites offline (ruling party,
    President's, Supreme Ruler's), and may have also taken email offline
    for Iran's Ministry of Interior.

    tank commanders could be seen tearing off their headsets – over

this day was great. not perfect maybe. But so much shit came together.
1) I decided what to do tomorrow at work. I face a critical decision
early on that could make or break me. The crisis had been vexing me. 2)
Harry and I monster-cleaned so a roommate candidate could finally meet
up with us, and she is somehow the perfect blend between Harry and me.
Maybe I'm lyin'; maybe she's too messy or too whiney liberal naive
collectivist brute. But overall I could see her fitting in chill. She
took an application and seemed to strongly consider the place and us. 3)
Another lead wrote back. I had blown her off because she said she's
'very neat'. I said she wouldn't be happy cuz the place is merely
'pretty neat'. She came back swinging about how that's cool, how she
just needs respect and cheap rent, and apparently she would be sleeping
here and also at another place. So I invited her over next week to meet
us. 4) Found a cool crate Monday evening and built it into my new
super-computer nightystand. A timer switch will cut the power to my
laptop around 9pm. Maybe that's too late. We'll see. 5) My massage guy
went to a workshop and learned some new approaches to his work, and so
he's got a whole other level of ability now. The new massage is more
painful but seems to be more powerful. He said his rates are going up in
April so I bought like eleventy billion sessions before then. Facia work
is cumulative and permanent! I got 99 problems but none come to mind.
Still some outright stunts to pull regarding my job and my equipment.

some kids were trying to bust the windows on the car in front of my
house so i called the cops. i guess they were in the car when the driver
was arrested an hour ago. well i don't care, don't come around trying to
bust in the windows. for your Keys? you're busting in the windows of
your "home boy"? oh that's mighty thoughtful of you. so anyway i spoke
with them and they asked me if it's ok they break in the window for the
key. i'm like, well, i'm not the cops. it's not like i can make it ok!
and i told them i already called the cops. who would assist them if they
weren't so shady. i told them i felt sorry for the hassle they're in.
two of the three ran the fuck off when i said i'd called the cops
already. the third guy listened and talked a bit more, and seemed to
appreciate my honesty and empathy. like, i can't \*un\*call the cops.
and really, i don't want to. your situation's shit and if you want to
break the window in, i guess you'll do it. i guess i wouldn't call the
cops again. anyway, whatever, i checked the door lock, turned down all
the lights, and have my machete. they aren't gonna retaliate, they just
want their keys. i don't want broken glass. sorry your friend got
busted.\

Gaddafi has mustard gas, though he doesn't have great ways to distribute

sky" to stop its use. We'd invade Iraq based on lies so let's consider
interfering in scenarios where real WMD's could be used. I don't care if
it's NATO or whatever. Don't sit on your ass as thousands hit the
streets tomorrow and might be gassed. Please Tripoli, please. End the
slaughter by killing the despot. I hope you get a lucky shot today. I'd
take it if I could. **Update:** Really hard to listen to. "The Friday
prayers have been attended by huge masses in an unprecedented show of
Libyan unity." People being attacked while on the phone to Al Jazeera.
"Libya army units, supporting the protesters, are among these
reinforcements entering Tripoli." "death toll is rising markedly now -
we cannot keep count of numbers." "We may die, but our sons will be
free." Estimates up to 50,000 marching toward Tripoli now. Remember:
Gaddafi has lost his mind, he's slurring on the radio about LSD in the
coffee and the Unabomber, he has mustard gas, and he has
\$32,000,000,000. THIRTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS.\

**Subject:** update\
\
At work Friday I had my first status review. The Big Boss (who is a
powerful cat in that group) said, "You know why I think this is
critical, right?" Me: "Thirty million users?" Him: "No, ninety-million."
If I do a good job, Microsoft scores a victory over Google, and if I
fail, Microsoft fails. I love this kind of seriousness. The hard part is
just beginning and I will need to be on both my tactical and strategic
game through the whole process. I don't mind! It's certainly way better
than the last job, where they gave me shit and yelled a lot and didn't
have shit for resources. What a crock of shit that was! I still hate
those jerks. But they'd die to have this many resources and this kind of
enthusiasm. It would blow their backwater minds! He said I was doing
better than he had planned, and he said he agreed with my recommendation
to throw raw HTML editing in the river, for the reasons I specified. And
he said of my big publishing question, "I want the best. If there's
costs, that's fine." Which means I can stop scrimping in my plan and
instead make an evaluation of the best solution, regardless of cost.
Which is great! I'm leaning toward MediaWiki! That's Wikipedia's wiki.
I'm very hopeful that I can get these guys wikified. It's the weekend
and resting and exercising are critical shit. Last night I went out, and
ended up at Shorty's drinking a very strong double whiskey. I met some
tourists from Portland who shared their racist views with me, mostly
about Mexicans stealing their jobs and black children harassing their
daughter. Then the guy gave me a tip on getting laid: Wear a wedding
ring! Apparently this triggers a skank's jealousy reflex. Pro tip!\

I went to 's play. I liked it. I'm tired today because I had whiskey
last night and didn't eat well today. Did shop for food. Loading up on
brain, energy, and immunity foods for work. Oh, work. Tomorrow I'm back.
I did have a good weekend though with a bit more bravery and charisma it
would have been better. Met some nice people. I'm scared of allergy
season. As soon as this weather thaws, like in 3 days, allergy season is
here. It's so much life in lockdown for me, abiding by best practices to
avoid allergens and maintain immunity. It's so sad because it makes me
so unhappy, shy, and tired. Still, I'm on the case like never before.
Going to get shots, going to try San Francisco. And I do have a job with
filtered air, which protects me. I might get an air filter. I'm shopping
for them. Yeah, tomorrow I'm going to work. It's so critical my weekends
are relaxing. Cuz what a job it is. I will need to Hunker The Fuck Down,
hitting every note, so to speak. A LOT. Because I've done Microsoft and
I've done Big Projects from Scratch and I've done Important Shit but
this fucker is all 3 at once. This is for the money, but it's also cuz
if I do this right, I've got cachet, street cred, aka legitimacy and

**Subject:** the shit right here called tuesday\
\
Today I was plagued by fatigue. I ate some blueberries and 73% cocoa
chocolate with almonds, as these items give some energy and brain power.
And this sort of worked, along with apple juice. Lunch was so-so, and
there's just something wrong with the corporation lunchroom at that
facility. Probably because everyone goes elsewhere for lunch. No salad
bar as far as I can tell. (Surrounded by skyscrapers with lots of food
options at street level.) The work, well, it was another tedious but
fruitful day of SLOGGING. I'm going to grind, grind, grind. I unearthed
the kind of shit I need to unearth. I just need to be focused. I can
find **something** to focus on, but is it the **right** thing? The big
boss asked me to direct my weekly reports to **his entire team** which
again reminds me **this shit matters to these people**. On jobs like
these it's good to accomplish one reportable, useful thing per day. It's
possible to do ambiguous but useful things, and I guess that's the rest
of the day. Measurability and reportability of labor progress is a
Microsoft hallmark in any case. Someone took my baby buggy. I don't
think Harry locked it up. It was dangerous anyway but it will be missed.
And WTF Harry? I left kinda early and napped at home. Going out to read
the paper with tea lifted my spirits. Tomorrow we might get a new
roommate. This is a big piece of my plan. Also I've started tracking
utilities (should have done so earlier) to derive my actual rent. This
is all part of giving myself options for relocating temporarily or
permanently. (Hint: Where the women are. These locals are girls.) Oh the
YMCA sauna is closed for another week so I have to go downtown for the
super hots, among the guys with their wangs out. LAME. At least I got my
March bus pass. I keep reminding myself I'm hunkering down for the money
and this time for the glory too, as this is "next level" shit
career-wise. Money-wise it's really timely to get a good job and milk
it. I'm hoping to exit with a firmer balance sheet, and if the third
roommate flies, we're talking an improved cost profile. It feels like
today is the kind of sorry, slogging day that long-term goals are made
of. The goal is to survive it while staying on track, and not give in to
despair and frustration. I still feel ambitious and optimistic. It would
be nice to get a date. Which I've been trying to do, and came close a
few times but got mostly ignored. I'm not upset about it but it's a SLOG
too. Mostly I should go where the numbers are in my favor. Fucking
software and west coast bullshit. I felt kinda sad today but really my
spirits have been very good. Allergy season is mere days away and that
will be time for despair and pity. Gird yourselves!\

\
Work day. My job is "oh hey how u doin cool hey free pizza cool oh hey

down acceptably. I'm digging and finding, figuring and fixing. I just
have to keep on the priorities, get good rest, eat right, and spend as
much time as I can doing the polish work. If that's not enough, then
it's not enough, but it's the only way it could work. There's this whole
side-issue about publishing platform and they're making me figure that
out, too. I'm this close to telling them all their options suck. They
get so x-cited about the fact I can publish html on the extranet. Ok,
but only AuthorIT is going to publish to raw HTML, everyone else expects
to be running on the server. And AuthorIT takes a week of training to be
capable. It sucks some shit to say, "Hey, you're all screwed." Well
there's Sharepoint wiki, and that's gonna win I bet. I did some research
on it and found people saying "hey, c'mon, this is good enough!" I'll
just "have my way" with it. It'll work! I'm feeling pretty burned today
but no nap was possible, because Jennifer came over. On Friday she will
become our a new roommate! She's 30, mature and honest, hard-working,
gets paid well, and gets high. We like her. She helps a professor with
his Saxon literature reviews. She has one degree (archeology?) and wants
two more. We met 3 people total in our lengthy recruitment process.
She's the best candidate. She will only spend 5 nights a week here,
tops, because she lives and works with an under-the-table house flipping
operation in Bum Fuck Egypt. So she won't even have to move a lot of
stuff here! We told her we get high and she was relieved cuz she does,
too. Hard-working, intellectual, mature, and she gets baked. DUDE SIGN
HER UP. And I did. Fuck yeah. Everyone is fucking happy. My rent's gonna
drop! Apparently she and the professor will come over and analyze Saxon
literature. Fine with me! I like cool people analyzing literature in my
livingroom and on my deck. It's not quite moving in a piano and a
player, but I'm calling this a good catch. Time for my victory lap: I
tricked this place out with lots of shelves, fixed fixtures, lovely
found furniture, replacing carpets, paint jobs, light bulbs, pest kills,
on and on and on. I get Harry to deep clean with me once a month. A
classy lady comes in and sees it all. Result: I've got property worth
renting! I've got two great properties worth renting! Which means I move
to the next goal: I can take a brief trip without a big overhead. Or I
can rent my own room out and totally relocate for a while. While
maintaining storage, access, and parking flexibility options. Capitol
Hill is calling? But I love beautiful real estate so much... presumably
it's more expensive up there than over here. Nobody said getting what I
want would be easy. At least I'm one step closer.\

Hittin the sack early tonight, with a scheme to wake up at sunrise and
get back in the sauna. Every March 1st, I get sick with respiratory
bullshit. This March 1st the YMCA decided to close the sauna. They said
it would be a weekend, but then they said it's a whole week. So I've had
to make do. I'm still sick. The key for this week will be avoiding
over-exertion, while keeping sauna breathing up, maybe twice a day,
surrounded by superfood meals and naps. If done correctly, it doesn't
have to consume as much time as it has (the resting has been insane,
second only to the hunger). I paid for a mondo air filter, the mother of
all air filters, which may or may not change my life. I've met a
surprising number of people with allergies who say their air filter
changed everything. If it doesn't change my life, I can always sell it.
Overall, things are ok. Illness always sucks. I got to read the paper
and have tea all weekend but that was it. Lots of stupid therapy baths
and robotussin, and the appetite was insane. I eat constantly! The
fucking asthma and the fucking lung obstruction doesn't leave, but I
have a bit more energy than earlier this weekend. It's going to be
Minimal Shit. I won't get fired for it, but it's not like I have a
choice. The only choice I have is how to explain it. If I had network
access, the impact wouldn't be so major. This is going to motivate them
to get on that shit. Some of this is stress related. My job is kinda
stressful because they want to make a lot of money. I just have to do my
thing and they can think about their money. My thing could move to
middle-of-the-night and I'd still fly this fucker in just fine. As long
as I get network access and don't relapse.\

I paid money (or probably will, after my one week free trial) for Hulu,
so i can watch *Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew*. I still see commercials,

addicted, my god. He didn't deserve that beating he got. Cocaine, crack,
opiates, Halcyon, alcohol. I don't touch these. Just marijuana, please.
Today I ate some. And I got to the sauna, which spiked my immune system,
and afterwards I was hungry and then super-tired. And I thought, well
yeah it's partly the pot, but there's an aspect of pot that just
amplifies what's going on in my body. Which was hunger to feed my immune
system, and then rest to let it rage. My friend is taking Valium, a
"benzo", for alcohol withdrawal. He is still taking the Anabuse to
prevent drinking, but he's also stopping the Anabuse and drinking again.
I've told him Valium is not a long-term solution, and suggested he get
sub-dermal (implant) Anabuse so there are fewer alcohol withdrawals,
therefore less need for Valium. He's gonna ask for an anti-anxxiety
prescription. He's planning a trip to Mexico for some medical tourism.
(He also needs his wisdom teeth out.) I got back into the sauna,
finally, twice today. And I fell into deepish sleeps. Sauna makes ALL
the difference in these allergy-related viral lung infections. Deep
breaths and I start coughing right away. I eat well and fall asleep and
the wheezing is reduced. Keep it up a few days and I'm cured. Gary Busy

Message on Benghazi state T.V.: "The army is coming to support you and
to cleanse your city from armed gangs. It urges you to keep out by
midnight of areas where the armed men and weapon storage areas are
located." Morale in Benghazi remains high. [*22:27 Al Jazeera
Arabic*](http://www.libyafeb17.com/2011/03/march-16-updates/) Eyewitness
from Tripoli called in and reported the hearing of very heavy gunfire
from within the military college. The eyewitness also reported that
screams could be heard with the words “no no!” being extremely audible.

prospect of a deadly siege of the rebel stronghold in Benghazi, Libya,
has produced a striking shift in tone from the Obama administration,
which is now pushing for the United Nations to [*authorize aerial

of gruesome urban shelling. I hope we can act.

opposing air assault! You can think of it like the rebels having the
greatest airforce in the world. Airforces can't win urban combat, but
they can stop troops moving in open, flat deserts. And they should. And
they will, GOD WILLING. **Update:** This audio is very disturbing. He's
on his cel, in a pickup truck, in a firefight. And then his cel goes
off. Everyone in the chat room is upset. **Update:** [*He was

**Subject:** that guy ben\
\
that guy ben came over this tuesday again. i guess tuesdays we have
salons and people talk. anyway, he started kinda arguing these silly
theseses, and this time i just raised my voice at nonsense and to be
honest, i largely shredded most of his arguments, which boil down to
America Bad. I don't think America Good, but I don't see quite the
pattern of bad that he claims to see but only vaguely defends. Anyway,
at one point I told him that he doesn't like to listen, and it was funny
cuz it was true. He listens, begrudgingly, but he doesn't *like* it. I
like to listen, but I will also respond to nonsense. Mostly we argued
about the legal authority of the UN, the meaning of sovereignty, and I
argued that an individual also has sovereignty, and a right to life, and
that the UN is as fundamentally based on the establishment and
protections of human rights as it is based on national sovereignty.
usually with guys who blow smoke up your ass i overwhelm them, because
their arguments are kinda paper-thin, it's just that nobody gives enough
of a shit to tell them what time it is. yeah, blowhard, blow. but i told
him what time it is, and how the UN kinda works, and why human rights
perhaps have more primacy than national sovereignty. i'm kinda good when
i get a kinda feeble blowhard who wants to talk politics. he kept
insisting early on that i was being hostile, but i only encouraged him
to yell his views louder, how is that hostile? he already expressed a
willingness to talk over others, so why not face volume and match it in
force? he already let that "i don't really listen that well" genie out
of the bottle, let it rage. but while i was yelling i listened to and
evaluated every word he said, and treated his views as fairly as they'd
be treated by someone who didn't have their head up their ass and did
believe in right and wrong as revealed through a Socratic and skeptical
view. it was like Democracy Now vs. the New York Times. Which is a plump
comparison, and brings me to the fact that Democracy Now is annoying and
strange, and the New York Times is, despite its faults, engaged in news

**Subject:** the research office bedroom\
\
My new roommate has two residences. She's a hard-working 30y.o. who
spends half her time investigating Saxon publications of the 1500's,
with a research professor, for nominal pay. It's sort of a
learning/getting paid/helping the professor thing. And they both spend
time in her room, doing this. Don't underestimate the challenge of Saxon
research. She's also basically his personal assistant. So this adds up
to them being in the room a whole lot I guess. I don't know if his
wang's out under the covers or what cuz they keep the door closed. But I
think, by and large, they do reserach together, and she like cares for
him in some fashion, as his personal assistant. And since she's
fantastic and he's at least interesting, I'm fine with everything.
Except not quite. Cuz I think if a professor and student are gonna do
research at my house, I want to be a part of it. Is that nuts? Well, if
I'm not, then it's kind of like I rented an office space. But if I did,
wouldn't I charge more? Answer: My low rent attracted this candidate,
who is saavy and very worthy of continued cohabitation. She's an asset.
She already told me I could raise the rent. She pays early. She's always
laughing. She eats the best food ever. She trusts us. **She's able to
clean up after herself.** Good God, why quibble? If anything, the
situation makes me realize how untidy my *other* roommate is, and why
not raise his rent? In the end I'll raise them both equally, probably,
in a few months. They're fine roommates. I need to raise the rent based
on utility costs, but implicitly there's politics to the whole money
situation, and I try to stay ahead of that curve using very
well-considered determinations prepared during a lot of introspections
like this. This house is about to erupt in child, and research be
damned!\

at my house, what's so bad? I have a great new roommate, just like I
planned. She offsets my costs and they're lower now than in at least a
year. And I earn more than I have earned since the recession began. And
in May I just might get a 12.5% raise. My sex plan got me two great
near-misses. So close! So heartening! I just have to convert, get a \#,
etc. Keep up the sex plan! Boils down to: Be visible, look great, say
hello, strike up a conversation. I want more structured exposure like
contact dance so I went to where it was supposed to be but it wasn't
there. My job is great. The boss has a great smile. His deputy is
supper-supportive. I'm on track to finish on time and under budget. It
will last another month-anda-half. So I'm looking for another job. And
I'll find it. I always do. Still, life is a crap sandwich. I see Chloe
once in a while. I tell her we can do anything but watch t.v. and eat
sugar. What a time we have. She calls me dad and says she loves me. But
she'll grow up in another city. I'll take hundreds of bus rides to see

Fuckin Friday sounds timely. This week was mad and vexing. I'm watching
*Monster*, where a prostitute that starts murdering. It's a true story.
It's pretty depressing. But America is pretty depressing. I don't say
that shit on Facebook. I guess I'm spanking it at work. TCOB I guess.
Doing it when I don't really feel great about it and also when I do
means getting it done over time. The project is starting to feel like
it'll wind up just right and I'll be done baby. The boss said he might
have more work for me. But presumably I must unleash the spanking
machine first. I think that's working but really I can't trust his "find
something for you" cheer job. I love this guy, he's great, he's a great
leader, and I do know how to do certain things he probably needs, but
come on, I'll finish this job and I'll be outta work and that's cool,
I'll find something else. The Bellevue skyscraper approach to Microsoft
is the best approach. Someone probably stole my roommate's motorcycle!
Can you fucking believe it? Or maybe the landlord hauled it away. I
might know more tomorrow. See? Shit like that. Shit's just fucking
happening and I'm pissed about it. I've been watching the Libyan war and
it's so fucking sad. I've seen enough executions! I still think the good
guys will win. Apparently I got kicked off some Facebook discussion
forum. Basically I was sick of some crazy lady flooding the place with
paste. She's fucking bonkers. I didn't care about the forum. I just
started asking, "Why are you doing that? It messes up the DISCUSSION!"
At least two people quoted me so absolutely I hit a nerve. Facebook
discussion forums are for retards. What a crybaby freak!! Well now she
can be a freak without fearing my wicked tongue! I'm sick of all the
tyranny and suffering in the stupid world these days. This famous

Freaking awesome. Whenever I work at Microsoft I start to kind of hate
where I'm at in the UDist. I deal with dumb shit like some asshole
stealing my roommate's motorbike, or fucking drama around smoking in the
fucking house and fucking up the air quality. STUPID CRAP LIKE THIS. And
it reverberates because the schlub retards gotta fucking turn the
cranks. I think about going back to my house, where I have no roommates,
but at least I'm around clean, healthy, rich people who have their own
brand of being fucking annoying.\

**Subject:** an update\
\
My life seems like it's in 3rd gear lately. Like, not hyper-amazing, but
faster than usual. Why? One reason is probably my job. Nobody cracks the
whip, everyone just smiles and cheers me on, but somehow the whole
mindset favors hard-driving success-oriented crap. The commute is
good/great. The food is plentiful and (pretty) healthy at work. There
are vistas. Skyscraper employment is A+! Resources are quite sufficient.
And the area I'm working is cutting-edge and interesting. This job
should last until June 1. Having a job like this makes me kind of hate
my home life. This always happens! Relative to the people at work, the
people around my home are kinda slow-moving and a bit freaky in the
brain. Yet I still must deal with their freak-outs and fumbles. I've
totally been feeling good lately. (Again, could be the job influence.)
I've been eating Omega3 like candy and this kinda helps. It's spring,
and I'm feeling this. So sometimes I'm home-bound or resting. That's
just life. My \$350 air filter, helping? Maybe it is! You know what
seems to be up? Breakthroughs. Like, why walk along the traffic? The car
traffic spews irritants and stinks. So I found an urban trail a
half-block from the roadway. It winds through car lots and stairways to
Qdoba for Mexican eats. I'm also going gung ho for SMS-based services.
Today's recruit: Onebusaway. I tried it twice, and while it didn't give
me accurate information, it was kinda helpful. I've realized I've met
women on the bus who I fell in love with at least twice, and I've
determined recently most of my flirtatious interactions occur there. So
getting on the bus is valuable. So maybe Onebusaway will help. I have a
big series of steps that will play out regarding my management of the
household. This involves negotiation with the neighbors about utility
costs. Once it's in place, I'll raise the rents in about 3 months. The
goal is to make the whole place ready for me to leave. Not sure if I
will leave, but I find myself wanting to be closer to capitol hill. I
want to live around (a) a sauna, (b) foot traffic of women I am
attracted to, and (c) easy work commute. So current job means stay where
I am until the job is gone. Currently I have a sauna but live near a car
nexus which is retarded as hell. And I could go to San Francisco, just
to see what's up, but to undoubtedly struggle with an unusual time-frame
that's too short to establish a presence. If I do leave, the plan is to
leave the option of returning to the apartment, or alternatively leave
it for good. There's some overhead but it's an experiment. Something
else I finally got around to: Flash cards. I'm learning (stock) position
management, and superfood details. I bought *Catch 22*. I want to move
my evenings to in-print reading, especially literature, and moving from
internets. I have a scheme to build a hub tthat shuts off my wifi at
9pm. I built a twitter app that will send me morning bell updates via
SMS about current positions, so i don't necessarily need to use computer
to review. "Progressive disclosure w/ push model" Decided I should
always have blueberries. Some items I've been planning forever but have
not acted on: 1) Get a 40" wide bed to fit into my lil nook. More space
in my room is good. 2) Immunotherapy. Should happen! But there's cost
and pain. 3) Cheap android or iphone w/cheap data plan. - keep dreamin!?
4) new glue on car rear plexiglass. looks insecure = is insecure! 5)
Hammock experiment on porch! Well I got two nice chairs from the street.
6) lots of other little improvements around the house that add up to
measuring and buying cut planks Considering it's april, the heart of
allergy season, i'm doing excellent. i've made every clear investment in
immunity and prevention, and maybe it's working. As for marijuana, I
realized I'm a social failure when I'm high so I don't get high before
going out. It seems like all these little realizations are adding up to
a better life. But no big payoff yet. Not sure where it's all coming
froM! juust seem motivated and goal-oriented lately. Work probably. I
have a high-stakes, challenging job with really good people.\

\$7,000 line in a scheme to get some long-term 0% credit, and it didn't
work. So what. Still, I would like to borrow \$80,000 without interest.
Not clear how I'll do this. Maybe start with a massive liquidity wave?
Just go to a different bank. Oh I had to talk to 5 people on the phone
to do this clusterfuck. That was the downside of getting the eighty
grand. Yap yap yap. One lady pitched me gas discounts! You know, for
cars! America is doomed.\

*Military forces loyal to Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, who have surrounded

rebellion, have been firing into residential neighborhoods with heavy
weapons, [*including cluster bombs that have been banned by much of the

about traffic jams. I know Emily isn't like me, but still it wasn't easy
to hear her asking, "What else are people gonna do?" with regard to
traffic jams. I guess we're doomed! Sit and wait! Which might be what
many people think. It just means a lot to meet someone who says, yep,
it's a phantasm of gruesome waste, fantastic machines, people's lives on
their asses. Lately I look around the neighborhood, and even though I
deal with it, it's full of cars. My god, it's full of cars. *The

this testament be my voice to the world, that I stood up to crusader

the West and its colonialist ambitions, and that I stood with my African
brothers, my true Arab and Muslim brothers, as a beacon of light. When
others were building castles, I lived in a modest house, and in a tent.
I never forgot my youth in Sirte, I did not spend our national treasury
foolishly, and like Salah'a'deen, our great Muslim leader, who rescued
Jerusalem for Islam, I took little for myself"* And you slaughtered

Stupid discipline! My wifi shut me off at 9pm, just like I programmed
it. Next it should shut me off at 8am! Then I'll wake up earlier and
leave the house earlier. All to... you guessed it... go to work! My
agency says I'll get a 12.5% raise if I defer half my income starting
May 1. Half! Live on half! This is a pretty big cut. So I'm fishing for
0% credit as a backstop. Didn't get high since some time last week. AS
EXPECTED, my room is super-clean. "So let me get this straight." No
internets after 9pm. No weed ever. AND COFFEE IS DOWN TO 2X/WK? I've
even switched to herbal tea! WTF SIR? I guess I want moar. I wanna be
super-outgoing. I wanna occupy a super-condensed space. About being
super-condensed: When I clean my room, I strive to maximize the space,
by ditching some stuff and nailing other stuff to the wall or stacking
it. I'm becoming a natural fit for a much smaller place, perhaps on cap
hill. I also have a scheme where I rent my own room out and put a bed
down in this closet by the front door. Then I go to San Francisco or
something, just for a while. I take junk seriously. Get rid of it! My
room now is super-simple. Cozy, but simple. The people around me, except
for Jennifer, are drowning in stuff! I guess they aren't going anywhere
so it's cool. But I want a room I can jump around in. I think about
voided areas in the walls I could open up. There's a basement in this
house that is unused. There's an old garage right outside full of junk
and completely unused. I dream of converting it into a nice place again.
And the place I have... I've installed shelves, hooks, all kinds of
places where the stuff I do own can stay, out of the way. My roommate
and his friends have trouble with, if it's not hoarding, it's certainly
losing the war on stuff. I made my roommate agree that nothing sits in
common space without permission. He's been totally helpful in this area.
His friends both have houses full of junk. And they're both slaves to
it. I guess seeing all this up-close helps me recognize the merit of
staying the fuck out of the junk business. One of his friends even says
she wants to rent out her condo and move to an apartment in the city.
But what about her stuff? What, indeed. I hope I never lose this
anti-stuff virus. Actually I own most stuff in the house. But it's
tools, two bikes, air filter and heater, many computers, buckets,
chairs, couch... The Stuff We Use Every Day. If I get a new apartment,
while still keeping this one in my name, I can take what I want and
leave the rest here. And that's my real vision: A short-term visit to
another place, followed by a return here. Why do people stay in the same
place so long? My roommate lived in a shitty basement for 12 years. His
friend has a condo up north... maybe ten or more years there. And their
other friend lives in an apartment north of here. They all sit and stay.
Same with their jobs. UGH. Just not my style. I like the area, but I
like changes in scenery and activities. Like this place. It has too many
bittersweet memories. Some happiness but not a lot. I ended up here when
I quit getting high a few years ago. I kept analyzing my life and
eventually I ended up here. Mostly for easy YMCA access, but Trader
Joe's and the Ave are also integral parts of my life now. It's been
nice. It's lovely in the summer. But it's got roads all around it, heavy
with cars. Meanwhile, people walk around on the quieter parts of Capitol
Hill. No cars required. Still, my rent now is \$588/mo, including
everything. Hard to beat! And it will go down soon. So you know,
whatever.\

*It was here on March 6 that the spark that lit the Syrian uprising was
struck: The arrest, detention and torture of 15 young boys for painting
graffiti slogans of the Arab revolution – "As-Shaab / Yoreed / Eskaat el
nizam!" "The people / want / to topple the regime!" on a wall, copying
what they had seen on television news reports from Cairo and Tunis. The
boys, aged between 10 and 15, were taken to one of the cells of the
local Political Security branch, under the control of General Atef
Najeeb, a cousin of President Bashar al-Assad. There in the gloomy
interrogation room the children were [*beaten and bloodied, burned and
had their fingernails pulled out by grown
men*](http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/features/2011/04/201141918352728300.html)
working for a regime whose unchecked brutality appears increasingly to
be sowing the seeds of its undoing.* REAL CLASSY. *"We were asking in a
peaceful way to release the children but their reply to us was bullets,"
said Ibrahim. "Now we can have no compromise with any security
branches."* **Update:** I'm pretty sure Syria is next, after huge
protests today.\

advantage and much higher morale. one said, "they've come to my home.
what could i do? stay and fight." they poured earth into the
intersections to prevent easy movement of the enemy, they cut off
snipers from re-supply, and they took the city back block by block. THEY
MADE A TANK FROM SCRAP METAL. the libyans have been fucking off in the
desert compared to the fighters in misurata. many believed they would be
routed. president obama agreed to provide critical low-altitude drones
for the urban fight but this was won without them. i pity all gadafi
forces now that low-altitude drones are gathering intel. libya's largest
city is under gadafi's control, but the 2nd and 3rd are not. 40% of his
military power is destroyed. i don't see a stalemate. he will implode!

i just don't get it. every dictator falls in a similar way. and it all
starts because disagreement with the rulers must be dealt with severely.
this is something americans can't really understand. i can demand the
fall of the obama regime. people do it every day! but if you're 14 and
you spray paint it, they'll torture you. and your family will express
outrage, and they'll shoot someone. and at the funeral people will
express outrage, and they'll open fire. and then it's all over. i know
friday prayers lead to friday afternoon protests. but this syrian
asshole douchebag apparently figured, ok, i'll let the political
prisoners go, and i'll lift the martial law, and i'll make some
minorities citizens, and **then** if anyone isn't satisfied, i will
shoot to kill. of course he's pals with iran, and iran knows how to
quell protests by force. but doesn't it require advanced surveillance
tools, and lots of discreet intimidation? and don't actual martyrs,
especially in bulk, fuck up the whole plan? how about rubber bullets? if
you use live rounds, the murders bring *everyone* into the street, and
their anger exceeds their fear. so how are you maintaining order??? and
then to fetch the wounded and the dead from hospitals, to hide your
crimes and raise people's fears... and to criticize twitter, facebook,
and youtube as biased sources on state-run t.v. (THE IRONY), while the
opposition crowdsources information about deathtolls and names... it's
like these dictators have no clue how to operate in the modern day. iran
has clues. infiltrate, monitor, intimidate, and disappear. china has the
same clues. i guess it's just harder to be a dictator nowadays. in
libya, the drones fly at 2,000 feet and fire weapons as well as
providing visual surveillance. at nato, a woman commands a staff of 100
to review and act. gadafi entered misrata up the main street, a 60km
straight and wide road, with dozens of tanks firing everywhere. (SO
CLASSY.) gadafi snipers occupied every building taller than 5 stories
along this main street. the rebels filled dump trucks with sand, drove
them to key intersections on the main street, and blew out the tires.
the side streets are a maze only locals knew. without re-supply, the
snipers ran out of food and ammunition. i hope syria isn't a bloodbath
like libya. syria loves to murder to stay in power. in 1982, they
murdered 10,000 people in one city to keep order. dead people are
certainly orderly people. but now it's every city. syria doesn't allow
reporters, so the news comes raw from camera phones. my mind still
boggles about this. i presume they can shut internet down, and maybe
that will happen today, but messages still get out.\

In Syria, 200 members of the ruling party resigned. That's good news.
Friday's Day of Rage has the support of the Muslim Brotherhood. Hundreds
may die. Also in Syria, some troops have refused orders to kill. In
Libya, Gadafi has always cherished loyalty above all things. Many Libyan
soldiers were killed for refusing to kill. But who knows about Syria.

The Yemen plan is dead. The guy backed out. So they're still fucked. The
Libyan ruler is still in charge, but some of his family died. Well that
sucks. But tell it to people in Misrata. People in Benghazi were doing
doughnuts in their cars under fireworks in response to the news. The
Syrian siege of Deraa continues. A moderate religious leader's son was
shot dead. You know how these nations have "day of rage" etc.? Sunday
starts the "week of breaking the siege of Deraa". Which sounds pretty
scary. I've been napping and trying to get my head straight. Doing
reasonably well at this. Apparently my internet shuts off in 28 minutes.

Update from the job front: 1) I'm refusing to feel anxious. Why feel

Hiring is solid and on July 1 it will be even stronger. 2) Google Voice
is doing great. No more fielding retard calls! Talk to the
speech-to-text! I'll get a hilariously transcribed text message. 3)
Slow. I put people on hold in email so I don't get an offer too quick.
4) I get the same two leads ten times each. Right now it's Amazon and
Lexis-Nexus. This is an opportunity to plumb the parties for pay rate
information. Find the party that commits to the most obscene rate. 5)
Match the voicemail with the email. If no email... is the voicemail
interesting? If not, just trash it. No sense calling to have my time
wasted! 6) Respond affirmatively, so they know I exist. 7) If I want San
Francisco, I have to show that I can live in the closet here at home, so
I can possibly find another occupant to take my room. Well, at least I
know what it would take. As always, I pity agencies who pursue me,
because I want all the money. I refrain from meeting with them or
talking on the phone with them because I know I take the money while
they think I'm a source of profit. Current angle: Go with existing
agency, and then claim their 12.5% pay increase through the obscene 401k
match. This probably means they will pay more, though I don't know how
they'll make a profit. Not My Problem. And it's not stressing me out.
Two full weeks to go on this job, and it's resume' candy. I'm gonna
deliver stellar fresh samples on a high-visibility project.\

car who will happily take TWO SPOTS where we park between the telephone
pole and the shed, so he is an ENEMY IDIOT who is apparently emboldened
by a sharpie and PostIt pad. not gonna note back. gonna find him some
day and have a real talk about (a) geometry and (b) don't take up two

life. it's important not to be one of them. Yeah I remember he's the guy
who rushed into a slot I was leaving. Which is normal. But it felt kinda
lame. And what goes into his thinking: If everyone just did everything
normal, THERE WOULD BE ENOUGH FOR ME. which is completely false. but
he's a child. a child with a sports car! the way i park in fact creates
space. there's this telephone pole and i am largely behind it. but since
it's DIFFERENT that's BAD. i've lived with this response my whole life,

I was working out in the sauna when the staff said I had to wear a shirt
and couldn't put my clothes on the bench. I can live with the shirt, cuz
it's just more laundry, but the clothes are a fire hazard? The assistant
executive saw them there before and said nothing! Shit like this makes
me mad. I'm gonna get off their donation hit-up list. Which is a baby
thing to do. Still, fuck this. Fire hazard? Are you nuts? (She's kinda
nuts, I guess. Rules are rules?) I asked if there was a complainant.
Nope. So basically she's saying every staff check I've experienced for
the last many years was WRONG. Or... SHE IS WRONG. It's one of those. I
understand if there's a complainant, and I am happy to adjust for anyone
who is uncomfortable. But when nobody is uncomfortable... I don't get
it. And I guess I don't comply. And if that gets me kicked out, that's
ok. Of course you must kick someone out for causing fire hazards and
showing mantits! I can comply with these dumb rules. I guess. Or maybe
proceed through another two years before she catches me again. I can't
really go anywhere else at the moment. Saunas aren't everywhere. And
they all have rules. But NOBODY wears a shirt. It's one of those dumb
rules that people break all the time and nobody cares, not even staff.
Me, I kind of want to protest, like, go ahead, kick me out of the Y and
stop taking my occasional donations! Because the walls must be safe from

**Subject:** some essay. supposed to be good for ya\
\
*Currently there is a tremendous amount of focus on Wall Street’s
mismanagement and businesses like Goldman Sachs, AIG Insurance, and
numerous Bank Executives getting enormous bonuses despite making blatant
bad business decisions. Members of Congress and the general public are
asking, “Why are these top executives being rewarded for creating huge
catastrophic failures?” Given what you have learned so far about the
processes and purposes of performance management, where do you think the
performance management systems of Wall Street failed,... or did they?
Support your arguments.* We need to establish some facts: 1) Goldman
Sachs did not make blatant bad business decisions. They did receive TARP
funds, and they did reward top executives in 2009, but with stock that
only vests in 5 years. That sounds like a sound compensation technique,
and they, while having a history of being near the heart of
market-destabilizing events, also prosper from these events, and usually
avoid SEC scrutiny and censure. Don't hate the player, hate the game. 2)
A small department of AIG made some enormously bad business decisions.
But Goldman profited from it! 3) Yeah, there were a lot of Bank
Executives that should have known better. For the purpose of argument,
let's assume a few bank executives made a big bonus after making bad
business decisions. What was the consequence of these decisions, from
the shareholders' perspective? For years, overrated CDOs fetched large
premiums, creating shareholder value. Then, when the ride was over,
federal bailouts prevented insolvency for most banks, and AIG was
notoriously supported at 100 cents on the dollar by the US Treasury. So
an argument can be made that the CEOs of major banks engaged in risky
lending, reaping huge returns for years, and then successfully persuaded
the American taxpayer to clean up the mess. This, while repugnant, is a
business strategy. With TARP and the AIG bailout, the taxpayer
subsidized the corporation and its shareholders. This is a brilliant
outcome from the corporation's perspective, and so arguably, many CEOs
acted in the interest of their shareholders, and deserve lavish
compensation. In the case of investment banks betting against their own
products such as CDO's, this is unethical and they have been punished by
the SEC. Any executive who engaged in this should not receive a bonus.
In the case of Angelo Mozilo, if the SEC levied \$67 million in fines,
Mr. Mozilo is not entitled to a bonus. I don't know if he received one.
But while these failures in ethics and good sense deserve no bonus, many
managers performed within their department in an era of legitimate
growing globalism and continued American dominance of the financial
sector. In the case of AIG, a tiny department incurred enormous
liability, and managers throughout this otherwise-sleepy insurance
provider performed admirably. Should a pitchfork public or grumbling
Congress deny them bonuses for their good performance? Perhaps so only
because in the end AIG itself serve now at the pleasure of the American
taxpayer. I do concur with the other student that a compensation
structure that favored short-term gains caused instability in financial
markets and a loss of shareholder value. Performance Management on Wall
Street would be substantially more effective if it compensated
executives based on long-term product performance and customer value.
Such a compensation philosophy could have prevented the collapse and
enhanced shareholder value over the long haul. There's a reason Warren
Buffett prefers long-term investors and suggests the world would be
better if we were limited to 5 trades per lifetime. Few bankers
understand what Buffett knows: An enterprise structured to grow returns
based on increased and sustainable customer value will outperform all
other models in the end. Performance management based on quick profits
might see them... for a while.\

the rest, that crazy place doesn't try to strike a bargain with a
censored internet. Good move! Poor video quality because people filming
video get shot, but some guy plays the old Libyan national anthem in
Tripoli. *The peoples response, which we were very disappointed not to
be able to get on film, was the most interesting. A crowd formed in the
busy square, unsure what to do, everyone just stood and stared. Even
security men were puzzled and stood motionless just watching. There was
a policeman standing right next to the carefully hidden speaker, and he
just stood there and took no action. Similarly there was a man in
military uniform sitting on the steps and he too just ignored the
anthem. It was a Katiba officer, the most loyal of gaddafi forces, who
eventually ran up to the speaker and kicked it. The whole square stood
on watching. Some men called for their children and quickly took them
away to safety. One man whispered, bravely, to my friend "wow this is
amazing, we better get out of here". There were many smiles among the
crowds. Security men began to mass around the mosque so we left the area
to safety.* ![The Misrata Mighty Lions are Getting Hungry! on

Dear John, You pointed out, "interdictor 4171 - This person stayed in

This is considered a hypothesis for our writing. Do you have any other
hints on certain people in the friending dataset? Or any hypothesis?
Well perhaps there are outliers like ... or the highly connected... but
really, i don't have many hypotheses about friending events. wasn't

\
Since my job ended I build or fix one awesome thing every single day! I
guess I did that before, but for a corporation, rather than myself.
Today's big great fix: I put the big bean bag on the porch and wrapped
it in a tarp! And now I have a hypoallergenic bean bag **and** a big
livingroom where the bastard sneezy beanbag was. I make these kinds of
choices and innovations alone. In fact, Harry grouses when anything
changes. I've had to accept that I am more creative and willing to try
stuff than my friends. I just wish I didn't have to fight fucking
gravity just to get people into a new idea. Mostly I mean Harry. He's
resistant to change. It took major pressure just to get him to move
here, even though it has been pivotal to his well-being. Well whatever
he has his own issues and hangups. I call this an engineering thing.
Some people can believe in a new approach or solution, and others can't.
Some people know a good idea from a shitty one, while others don't. Some
people fixate on certain facts, while missing others. I guess they just
don't have The Gift. Even Bill, who writes creative novels, struggles
with real-life problem-solving. His thinking actually leads to poor
outcomes, and I am constantly tossing in gentle persuasions. He usually
realizes I had it right. I'm trying to save him money and hassle but
there's occasionally no reasoning with him. He's kind of the
anti-engineer, because he pursues bad ideas with zeal. Reasoning is the
stuff I crave! I don't mind being the source of both good ideas and good
judgment. I only mind it when I sense active resistance. I don't have
time to solve the problem *and* solve whatever the fuck makes you resist
the fix. Some years ago I was fixing major problems at work with
engineering. Some technical writers can think like engineers, and others
can't. One guy's stillborn notion of engineering involved specifying
potential problems with a design, more like a tester. I shouted at him
that I didn't know what would happen if he did XYZ, and maybe he should
go try all that shit and report back and until then STFU. It shut him up
and that was my point: Lead or get out of my way. I don't love fixing
your problems, especially if I get the sense you are worthless or
hostile to this task. I've since decided that if I'm engineering at
work, I'm not super-happy, as I'd rather be writing. So if I get to lead
an engineering effort, everyone better fucking shut up with crazy
criticism. Give me good ideas and good feedback or remain quiet. Emily's
no engineer. She wants to take Chloe on a road trip to California. I am
a little sad because I couldn't talk her into letting Chloe ride a train
with me. Sad, depressing, and dangerous, but she wants Chloe immobilized
in a child seat for 14 hours. I hope she brings a sedative! I look at an
outcome like that as a major failure but she clings to it like it's a
great idea. So I'm working through my own California plan, which
involves a lot less driving, a lot less time, and a lot more great wins
for camping. All because I put train, plane, shipping, and cars on the
table and mix-match-create. Maybe I'm talking about creativity +
judgment + motivation. I relish interesting problems and maybe other
people dread them. My apartment is full of novel solutions. I love how
some solutions are sitting right in front of me, but I just never saw
them before. That reminds me how great solutions are everywhere,
lurking. I just wish I didn't feel alone innovating and problem-solving.
Akiko was smart, but I remember how I'd ride a bicycle in the night to
find a jazz club and catch a show. She said she wanted to see a show,
but her idea always featured a car, and parking a car, and somehow
finding a show from a car. I know a lot of people do it with listings
and paying for parking etc but I just find stuff on a bike PROBLEM
SOLVED. True, but just for me, and people like me willing to ride a bike
at night. I'd rather date a fleshlight if it means I don't have to drive
your ass the restaurant every other day. I remember suddenly at the end
Akiko became willing to walk 10 blocks to a restaurant rather than all
that fake convenience death shit. After it was too late she changed.
Well screw her. Then she moved to BFE and drives a car every day now I'm
sure. Whatever. Cars are great tools when their plusses and minuses are
appraised alongside the alternatives. Once you lock in to a car as a
primary transportation problem solver, you're doomed and you will bore
and annoy me.\

**Subject:** Syria Update\
\
In Syria, a 13-year-old good kid who gave to the poor insisted the
people in a town under siege with no food or water should have food and
water. So he went to bring bread. He was arrested. 25 days later, his
body was returned. He had been sadistically tortured to death. He is now
fueling nation-wide calls for an end to the rule of Basher Assad, who
seems unable to adjust to youtube. His usual techniques of intimidation
are backfiring. This uprising began when 15 young boys were arrested in
that same town, accused of writing graffiti slogans against the
government on a wall. Thousands marched demanding the release of the
children, calling for greater political freedom and accusing the
government and its institutions of corruption. The security forces
killed at least four people. Then they did release the children, who
showed signs of torture during detention. The families of the boys
repeatedly asked the local government agencies to punish those who were
responsible but as their pleas were ignored the protests grew larger,
spreading to the rest of the country. As the protests increased so did
the killing of protesters and their arrests. So, see, he'll torture
children to stay in power. What a special kind of fuck. And this has
signs of being his undoing. But Russia protects this schmuck, so the UN
Security Council is not potent here. I've been arguing with a thug who
supports Assad. He's a tricky liar in the way you hate... if a roommate
thought this way, you'd punch him and lock the door. Understanding and
neutralizing stooges like him seems like the least I can do for Syria.
Like Assad, he also seems unable to understand the force of internet to
dissect lies and respond with truth and rage. All the old techniques of
fear-making fail. Friday's protests, typically the largest, are for the
30 children killed in the uprising so far. I think the Syrian resistance
has struck on a potent force. Or rather, Assad handed them a great new
weapon. If your government kills kids, who is for it?\

**Subject:** Wherein we examine a thug\
\
Here's a Syrian thug on Twitter: http://twitter.com/\#!/3arabiSouri
Watch his way with words (in reverse chronological order): *It's funny
that foreign media still replays the news of \#Hamza death as being
under torture despite this report: http://t.co/2FtTi1z \#Syria* That's
his biggest beef: Syrian state TV examined this! It's all a big lie! And
Syrian state TV wouldn't lie! *\#Syria When calling relatives in
Damascus we hear comforting news except 4 economics, we watch foreign
media the country is in civil war!!* Nobody says Damascus is in open
revolt. STRAW MAN *When we call 4 the stp of violence 2 cease the lost
of further lives in \#Syria we r accused of being pro regime. When we
call 4 further fast & steady reforms we r accused of being part of a
foreign conspiracy. We R Syrians who wnt a decent living in a stable
country.. PERIOD* At first this sounds like I've gotten to him. But I'm
convinced he's a sociopath. If you read more, you realize he doesn't
care about lost lives. Nor does he care about lives lost solely for
expressing dissent. Won't even acknowledge it's happening. *Attending a
horror movie seeing strangers being killed is totally different than
living the killings itself & losing dear ones. \#Syria* This is one of
his main arguments. He's probably right that some international actors
advocating for change in Syria are young and largely unaware of risks.
But why is anyone being killed? For dissent. Not for taking up arms.
*\#Syria Who claims that those who die R for a better tomorrow, it's not
worth it, it's becoming more clearer that it's a struggle for power.*
Here I think he pulls a classic tactic for spreading powerlessness. "a
struggle for power". Hell yeah it is. The power to live vs. die. The
power to run the government in a democratic manner. But to say "a
struggle for power" is to sully those participating as merely
self-interested thugs. Like him! That's the irony in so many of his
messages. *@mcfnord u r the only 1 till now talking about deaths due to
home shells, maybe u predict, plan? Or maybe wish so that make headlines
\#Syria* This is where I really started to understand him. Death by
shelling was on front-page of WSJ and NYT. That he hadn't heard is
plausible, but to move there from "predict, plan" suggests he seeks to
attribute the worst of intentions to parties. I often reflect on my
experiences with genuine inquirers, such as PhD students, researchers,
and successful investors: They aren't in the business of attributing
miserable intentions to parties. No, that's reserved for thugs engaged
in divisive and belittling rhetoric. *@i\_magpie Go there & do it
yourself.. Do Not Use Children.* This is a phase he went through, once
again claiming great concern, wherein death to children and activity by
children engaged in protest were equated with sending them to death. And
why do they die? Because the government kills them. This is the sort of
logic I attribute to Gadaffi and other dictators. Oh, we care so much!
*@mcfnord Reuters & they were caught twice at least distributing false
videos & they apologized. God knows what else they did.* Worth including
as it's his response to the allegation that Syrian state TV might lie.
Reuters did it! Of course there's a chasm between an accident and a lie,
but he glosses over that, and extends the false thesis to suggest
there's a lot more lying going on by Reuters. Pretty classic deflection
and smear. *\#Syria Either I'm the only one who saw hard evidence
refuting claims of \#Hamza Khatib torture on Syrian TV, or the plan is
in progress to partition Syria is in progress & can only be stopped by
open minds of the Syrian people.* He really clung to the idea that
Syrian state TV propaganda legitimately re-writes the story. I'm not
sure why he does this. Because he thinks this way, or because he's an
opportunist grasping for credible propaganda? I think the latter now. He
did seem really enamored with the propaganda piece, and seemed to think
it would change things. *@mcfnord No, I don't want \#Assad to retire
now. The opposition failed badly in finding a replacement, once they do,
I'll call on him to leave. Now it's too dangerous to create a vacuum of
power. If there's a military coup it's fine, if not, Syria is not for
partitioning or for sale.* Kind of interesting. Certainly an element of
"oopsie, you lost your chance to have legitimate grievances!" typical
of, say, China or Iran, who might not overtly prohibit you from dissent.
If he's starving and shelling people for disagreeing with him, one might
think that would prompt calls for his departure. Alas, Assad himself
clings to this repeated notion of a power vacuum or a loss of
sovereignty, and this guy repeats it. In yesterday's WSJ, a reporter
said even Assad's own staff has trouble accepting this rationale for the
crackdown. *@mcfnord I'm sure whatever reveals the plan is already set.
Btw, just for the records I'm not pro Assad & was never. Read my
previous tweets* Loved this. The plan is set! We're so powerless! As for
his position, there are two rational options here: Drop shells on people
as you starve them, or don't. He sees a third way, in which he's
anti-Assad yet... pro-shell. So I think he's lying here, but not sure.
*@guardian Yr readers deserve clarification about the story of \#Hamza -
Syrian Revolution icon after Syrian TV reportage http://bit.ly/jFYOey*
It seems like he really did see mileage in the propaganda piece if he
was willing to direct legitimate news outlets to it. *@IAssil @omarassil
I thought after the \#Syrian TV reportage on \#Hamza u guys will feel
shy & stop abusing children in your failed game* Perhaps this
illustrates what role propaganda TV plays in the attacks by
third-stringer thugs. DIDN'T YOU SEE THIS REFUTED ON TV? Now we know
you're illegitimate! Child abuser! *We highly condemn the brutality of
US police against its own civilian citizens RT @HuffingtonPost: Cop
caught http://huff.to/mdgZe3 @amnesty* He likes this tactic of pointing
out miniscule matters in Western press and implicitly comparing them to
the mounting deathtoll. See? Nobody's perfect! This one's pretty common
among many stripes of deluded souls. *\#Syria Tell me what would be yr
reaction if u r guarding an army post & there's a bunch of people coming
towards u chanting FREEDOM angrily* This one sticks with me. Maybe he
had the job of shooting down an angry crowd. Maybe just classic
apologism. Certainly he's got demons if he lies so aggressively for an
indefensible position. And he seems to represent the darkest forces of
propaganda in the service of illegitimate power. I'm always remembering
Nazism as a force in humanity that never leaves against which we must be
vigilant. You bet there are miniture Goebbels running around the world
and Twitter. **Update:** He found my review and had this response:
*@mcfnord Wow, I thought I blocked u to concentrate on the killings u

human nature & behavior in response to events, or perhaps u missed

Today I read yesterday's NYT and embarked on an occasional ritual: Glue

Today I glued: 1) The loose formica around the bathroom sink. 2) A latch
on my bedroom window. 3) Vinyl on a metal shelf top. 4) A small piece of
my handrail, which is too rotten to hold paint. I just slather on the
glue to form a new surface which I then paint. 5) Second pass at my

had formed. All projects succeeded pretty well!\

KICK EACH OTHER IN THE BALLS. He wasn't even responding to me! That's a
TOTAL SIGN. He was responding to some thing in his head, not me. Good
God what a loser! And Twitter is full of freaks like him. 2) For the
second time, some NUMBER WITHHELD started robo-calling me. I just turned
the phone off but still man oh man. Like 10 times at least. So anyways.
When I stop getting high, THE WORLD ANNOYS ME. Last time I quit I ended
up MOVING. Which was a smart move, now. I had to go through a lot of
shit with... freaks and jerks first. I really like the insult "RETARD"
but have been omitting it out of sensitivity to people who are
challenged in their thinking skills. I could say all day it's not about
them but words mean stuff and so that word is out. Same with FAGGOT.
Same with NIGGER. It's just dumb to say. I don't mean gays and I don't
mean brown/black people. Actually I don't use NIGGER but I have certain
irrational racist thoughts in some scenarios due to my upbringing maybe.
I love gays and blacks and people who don't think at a typical level.
I'm not a hater! Then Rachel got under my skin by saying she's at some
restaurant out in Madison Park and then chiding me for not texting her
back? Said I was impolite? HOW POLITE IS IT TO SAY YOU'RE AT SOME
RESTAURANT RATHER THAN YOU KNOW OFFERING TO PICK ME UP AND TAKE ME THERE
OR AT LEAST GIVING ME SOME LEAD TIME NOTICE? Nope, it's about phones!
It's about messages! Politeness is about obsessive texting not
consideration. OH FUCK OFF. So yeah I feel really annoyed and marijuana
withdrawal is part of the cause. Here's something: I drink a teacup of
red wine DAILY for my health. Harry thinks this is just pure addiction
and useless medicine. He claims bok choy or some shit is like 1000x
better. IT'S LIKE HE TAKES A CRAP ON SCIENCE. But Harry never claimed to
give a fuck about science. The science of moderate intake of red wine is
clear and far-reaching. So the guy in Twitter was saying I was a DUM
DUM. This is one of his CARDS IN THE DECK. I was like, HMM, I READ THE
WSJ AND NYT ALMOST EVERY DAY. Which I don't claim makes me SMRT. But I
mean IT'S NOT USA TODAY. I really have to spot creepos faster on
Twitter. I feel sad and superior and they look like easy prey but really
they are sociopathic in their disregard for both other people and
reality itself so STOP, DROP, AND ROLL OUT. But it's a bummer cuz
basically dialogue is rare there in my experience so far except with
TRUE PSYCHOPATHS. LOOK AT ME! I HAVE A TWITTER! INSULT-CITATION-LINK
INSULT-CITATION-LINK! There's one variety I call LINKTARDS and he wasn't
one of those. He was a GET OFF MY LAWNer. I had a run in with a Tea
Partier there who said the Arab revolutions are replacing Islamic
dictatorship with another. UM NONE OF THEM ARE ISLAMIC DICTATORSHIPS
THEY ALL BASICALLY MADE ISLAMIC PARTIES ILLEGAL but NEVER TALK SENSE TO
A TEA PARTIER. Um ok what else. I dunno, I just think MOST PEOPLE ARE
PATHETIC and those who aren't ARE TOO BUSY TO PLAY WITH ME. This rant is

i dreamed hillary clinton was Chloe's mom and and i were at a summer
camp golfing. UPDATE on the guy at the YMCA who doesn't like when I do
yoga in the sauna. I came out from the sauna and all my stuff was gone.
I want to the guy and said, "Can I talk to you?" And he said WHAT. He
smelled a bit of alcohol. And I said, "All my stuff is gone! It was
right over there!" And he said, "I was here the whole time!" Which was a
lie. But I played on. And I said, "It was right there! And now it's
gone!? Did you see anyone?" Getting anxious. And he walked to where it
was and started opening lockers. And I said, "Hey that's a great idea!"
and I started opening lockers. Cuz really maybe someone did put them in
a locker. AND MAYBE MONKEYS MIGHT FLY OUT MY BUTT. And after he opened a
minor \# of lockers, he went into the next room, and LO AND BEHOLD in a
place only a magician would look, there's all my stuff! No one has ever
touched my stuff before. The Y was almost empty at the time. SO WHERE AM
I NOW? Well I thanked him! And now he's my friend! Right? Right? NO OF
COURSE NOT. But that's how I'm playing it! 1) Take my valuables with me
to reduce risk exposure, and 2) Treat him like he's my best friend. CUZ
HE HELPED ME, RIGHT? I even popped in a moment to tell him thanks again!
WHAT A HELPFUL GUY. I think he was a little taken back when I went right
to him, yet did not confront him. I figure addicts and thugs are
accustomed to patterns of behavior CAUSED BY AND CONTRIBUTING TO THEIR
LIFE BEING SHIT, and are off balance when the patterns don't develop in
the usual way. Regarding his territorial pissing, my yoga practice can't
be performed if someone's all worked up about what I'm doing, so he
totally gets his way on that score. I intend to say again to my new
friend, "Hey, can I talk to you for a minute?" Then I will explain my
10-year relationship with the practice, how it keeps me alive, and I
will explain that if someone's bothered by it, then it's not being done
right. Then I will explain that if I see him in the sauna, I will say
hello and go away for ten minutes. HOPE THAT'S ENOUGH YOU UNDEMOCRATIC
ALCOHOLIC! A counter argument is that one shouldn't yield to a thug. But
if someone's acting like a douche just because I'm doing yoga, how the
hell would I handle that? So the douche wins, as douches often do, by
being a belligerent douche. FRIENDS CLOSE, ENEMIES CLOSER. LOOKING
FORWARD TO ACTING LIKE HE'S MY BEST FRIEND FOR HELPING AND FINDING MY
STUFF. WHAT A THOUGHTFUL GUY! Acting nice is a lot easier for me than
playing this harsh game he prefers.\

there's a lot of shit i think about writing down now and then, but very
little i actually write. one thing: so, the guy in the sauna isn't a
bully, or a thug, he's a hater. and my biggest weapon against him is
simply this: go early. which is interesting when you boil it down: work
out early, because when you work out later in the day, a big, angry,
black man will hide your clothes and tell you real loud to shut up. IT'S
A GREAT REASON TO WORK OUT EARLY. motivational but my empathy for his
poor, poor pain has waned. he's a hater because his world is too small.
he savors control of the ymca sauna, because he doesn't have anything
else going on. it's his life now. and sharing that life hurts. if he
won't articulate this pain, and just yells that i should shut up, then
leaving him be, should we inevitably meet again, isn't quite the right
answer. i'm still not sure what the right answer is. other than waking
up early. but i figure i should be the opposite. i should be a lover.
which means telling him it's good to see him, and inviting him to lunch.

**Subject:** my complexities\
\
Monday will be a pile of shit, followed by roller skating with Chloe.
It's her birthday! I have to go to Tacoma, find a mechanic, tow my car
to their shop, and just wait for a price. If it's too much then car is
dead. LONG LIVE CAR. CARS REQUIRE A LOT OF SHIT. We're getting ready for
4th camping. Without the car I have to haul stuff to Tacoma by hand. So
Harry found a shopping cart, which gets my basket to the bus, and I can
drag it on a rope through my one bus transfer. I like fancy tricks like
this. It happens that a good many of my camping dealios are already in
Tacoma, because I brought them to the birthday party in the blown up
car. I can't control whether the car lives or dies. I'm gonna accept it
either way. I hope I can find the damn title. http://yowayowacamera.com\

first, my car is totalled. i'm not even gonna ask. it's just dead.
goodbye, car. i'm gonna sell it for \$150, or maybe even \$200. i blame
me. i ignored the oil light. fuck me i'm stupid. second, allergies. mine
are severe. and this means a lot of shit for me. a lot of shit i can't
do. won't do. know better than to do. won't go where there are cats.
EVER. won't go where there are dogs. dogs i can survive a little longer
than cats. won't go near cigarette smoke. won't risk eating peanuts.
won't go where it's dusty, or where there's ammonia in use. and some
perfumes can harm me for weeks with a single exposure. and so what about
other people? i appreciate when people are concerned for me. i
appreciate it when they think of me and make good choices. THIS CAN
EASILY SLIP INTO REALLY ANNOYING MOMMY TYPE TALK OR WHATEVER. "OH JOHN
DON'T DO THAT YOU'LL GET SICK" LIKE I HAVEN'T SPEND 41 YEARS FIGURING
OUT WHAT MAKES ME SICK. and as for women i might date, sadly obviously
some love their cats more and so they're out. some smoke and they're
out. some are just stupid or pig-headed and they are out. like, some
just have to use some shit detergent, and i should just cope? or "be
careful" ? because their connection to the detergent means more than me.
or the peanut sauce is so delicious. if it's so delicious, don't go to
dinner with me. basically i take \*every\* precaution, and since i have
an engineering mind, that means stuff like HEY, NO PEANUT SAUCE AT THE
TABLE, NONE IN THE HOUSE, NO PERFUME IN THE HOUSE, NO RISK OF CIGARETTES
IN THE PLAN, NO POTENTIAL CAT HAIR EXPOSURE ON MY CLOTHES. sometimes it
distinctly feels like friends want to play roulette with my life. OH,
IT'LL BE FINE. Like once I went to this asian buffet where peanuts were
in some dishes and i started freaking out very badly when i realized i
might be having a deadly reaction and the last face i might see would be
this hippy i met from the Y who was saying, "oh, it should be fine." the
sort of certainty one might have substituting margarine for butter, or
not using original Honda parts in their repair job, this is the kind of
certitude they'll use on my very life. so... in addition to no smokers
or cat owners, i allow no dummies, and no pig-heads. the pig-heads
really hurt because they think something like how i'm a buzzkill or i
shouldn't be so serious. one cat exposure can ruin an entire day or
more. i was trapped in one elevator with a severe perfume two months ago
and i still have medical effects. i am blessed with the intellect it
takes to manage a good life despite these drawbacks. but other people
hurt. their attitudes and behaviors hurt. sometimes i felt belittled or
ignored in my last relationship due to my limitations, and that hurt a
lot. i have no mercy anymore. no cooperation with violence. i am
successful because i defend my limits with harsh severity. few things
hurt more than being harmed for 24 painful hours, and then being
belittled or ignored in my pain, because i'm such a loser baby. and
before the harm, to have my needs or concerns (FEARS) disrespected or
devalued... nobody who does this will ever be trusted and i question if
i could even love them.\

I did what I needed to do today: I sold my car. \$190. They should pick
it up tomorrow. I will miss that old, dirty bastard. I love an old car
that runs well, but with parts that don't work. Safety matters,
everything else doesn't. I love when parts break. Pieces fall off. I
glued nickels to the hood. I made a hatch window out of plexiglass. I
tore out the carpet that molded when the window leaked. I drilled a hole
to release water accumulating in the spare tire bay. With cosmetic
pieces falling off and pieces improvised, the thing was transforming.
Time for the next phase. I am a poster child for Zipcar. Fate just
nudged things along. I paid \$1,000 each year for various serious
repairs. I can shovel that much into whatever rental schemes make sense.
But it won't feel the same. I love a house I can drill, nail, gut, and
paint. I love a car the same way. It has new tires. Those alone are
worth \$190. But so be it. Goodbye my friend. May u deliver pizzas in
car heaven.\

in my dream i was Mister Blue, a mysterious party to a legendary series
of events. i wish i remembered the events. i was all set to publish a
record, even being instructed to press the groove pattern down into the
vinyl disk when interest in my identity caused me to reconsider. did i
want people drawing their own conclusions about what happened and what
role i played? then i was at my mom's house. all the toilets were
blocked. i kept calling my friend but got through to someone at a
pizzaria who said she didn't know me. i got a ride back to seattle. this
dream is about identity and authenticity but i can't remember the
legendary series of events. only after i awoke did i realize i should
publish as Mister Blue.\

\
I've lost creativity. I don't create anything. Well, TODAY I worked on
little projects around the house: \* hang some art \* trim and water the
roses \* clean up from camping \* bring some good street finds home i
was creative at my old house. was it because it's beautiful there? or
did akiko inspire me? i made stuff there before i met her. it is an
inspiring place. maybe this place is not. i make nothing anymore. i used
to make a lot. my car sold today. so i don't have a car. so i don't need
this place for the ample parking anymore. it's cozy and it's pretty. but
it's not magnificent. the only thing my old house needs is a sauna. i
can get one. easy enough. and here's the trade-off about this place:
i'll just say it: women are more interested in me at my other place.
they see the place, they see me, they figure: OK PACKAGE DEAL here they
feel freaky about my roommates and there's not much of a view. so i want
friends around, it's great to talk to my roommate friends. but at the
end of the day IT'S NOT QUITE WHAT I'M AFTER.\

**Subject:** summer of epiphanies\
\
My two major breakthroughs this summer: 1) Smoking pot is a dead end.
Vaporize it instead. 2) A better choice is A+ great even if it's not the
best choice! 3) Women love roses. I read a study that determined the
mere presence of flowers increased female consideration 30%! I have this
rose bush outside my house. It has hundreds of roses. I started putting
a rose bud in my hat every time I left the house. The fresh ones are
best but they dry attractively to form a hat fascinator. My massage guy
totally loved some I got for him, cuz his young daughter's a flower
fanatic. When I say I harvest them, almost all women are temporarily
stunned, like a deer in headlights! Some giggle. I love when an answer
appears after hiding in plain sight for years. It means knowledge is the
greatest power. So this week I've been trimming, watering, and
nourishing the hell out of this majestic rose bush. I regret missing
most of the first bloom because I need to build scaffolding and
stabilize ladders. Long-term it's an easy proposition. I'm going to
sculpt the host tree (the rose vines live in it) to give the roses sun,
and only grow as high as I can reach. I will corner the market! I feel
like a big deal! UPDATE on big, black man in sauna who hides my stuff,
intimidates and harasses me: He does it to other people, too. He's like
65, doesn't like white people, and fought in Vietnam. I'm unaccustomed
to interacting with people who are so supremely negative, and feel
nearly mute around them, because what's worth saying when every response
is vile? But I've turned this guy into an asset: IF I DON'T GET OUT OF
BED AND GO TO THE YMCA AT A MORNING HOUR, THE ODDS RISE THROUGH THE DAY
THAT A LARGE, ANGRY MAN PRESUMABLY WITH COMBAT EXPERIENCE WILL
INTIMIDATE AND HARASS ME IN A SMALL, HOT, DARK ROOM WHILE I EXERCISE.
This new motivation to wake up and work out has also improved my life
substantially lately! My friend said to give the guy a "wide berth" and
do not fuck with him. Which is obvious but thanks for the tip. I was
surprised to learn (a) he does the same stuff to other people, and (b)
he's 65, and (c) he was in Vietnam. It helps me understand him better.
He looks kinda young which made me wonder if he was mentally ill when he
said he doesn't need yoga, cuz it's worthless. No, he's just set in his
ways! ONE LAST THING: Happiness is associated with the accomplishment of
goals that are intrinsically chosen and of appropriate difficulty, for
which there's a clear connection between effort and reward! It's easy so
learn it!\

\
i got laid once like over a month ago. with you-know-who. i dress
pretty, i talk to strangers. way prettier than in the past. way more
visible. way more friendly and talkative. many reasons for this. mostly
cuz i realized HEY I GOT BUPKIS so i focused on pretty and outgoing and
friendly and etc. i went on a few dates w/ someone but she turned out to
be a contrarian. she gave me the "gotta be serious" vibe, so we went out
some more and she turned out to be a troubling contrarian, kind of
vicious in her counter-pointing, like i'd punched a dog, which is bull.
so she's out because if it's gotta be serious, it can't be like that. SO
I MEAN THAT'S PROGRESS RIGHT? That's something.\

**Subject:** whack-a-mole\
\
Communications through Twitter have taught me a lot about tyranny and
one-party rule. One guy makes lists of enemies of the Syrian state. I'm
on two of the lists: One for inciting violence, and one for spreading
"unapproved information". The whole concept of "unapproved information"
boggles my mind, and I've counseled him to call it "unconfirmed
information" but he's pretty happy with his wording. The people who
defend the Syrian state do so with creepy rhetorical tricks they're
willing to use all day long. I'm attracted to deceptive rhetoric, and
these people peg my meter. I've interacted leftist whackaloons who think
NATO is killing lots and lots of innocent Libyans... these people are
99% nutters. Some people willfully reject the facts, while others build
a campaign against them. In the Syrian case, the misinformation
campaigns seem aggressively organized. Which is to say the defense of
one-party rule against any enemy is a full-time job, especially when the
party in power is a rat. I oppose China's one-party rule, but did skim a
2-page advertisement defending it. China insists it's critical to its
industrialization, which might be accurate, but doesn't take the stink
away. In Syria's case, one-party rule is just the maintenance of a
minority group's exclusive hold on power, and includes cronyism and
brutal suppression of other groups. In the Y today I met a
(long-retired) Marine who told me he didn't like bullies who prey on the
weak. I told him the Marines are there to protect the weak, unusual
cheerleading on my part after battling these Syrian thugs all night. I
know American history well and expressed my continued skepticism about
our militarism, but compared to one-party rule with "unconfirmed
information" and routine torture of powerless parties, the United States
starts to look great. Propaganda and trickery are a characteristic of
power everywhere, but our fortune is an open press that can expose these
classic schemes. This can take a long time, but at least it's possible.
I tell these Syrians sometimes that the whole internet is antagonistic
to their schemes about spinning and controlling information. Twitter
undoubtedly battles major corporate pushes to spin information, as well
as national ones. Here's how an alleged scheme to silence pro-Assad
tweets works: http://t.co/nh4TuJr Clearly Twitter faces a somewhat
timeless Internet problem of giving everyone a voice but preventing that
voice from dominating the conversation. Here's how well LJ is doing at
this same challenge: http://lj-research.livejournal.com/38714.html You
better believe that the upcoming American political cycle is going to be
a huge propaganda assault, through internet especially. It's going to
seem similar. But the pro-Assad Syrians lack enormous resources for
focus groups, and even lack background in democratic values like
respect, or even plausibility, a propaganda fave. All of this shows me
how valuable getting and keeping power is. If there are lies to be
repeated, parties have their apparatus for that. And if what you're
doing is indefensible, lies are all you've got to go on.\

i had a job interview 4 days ago. i still think about it. it was just so
comprehensive and intensive. i was kind of annoyed by the whole thing.
"who was your best boss ever and why." they asked so damn many questions
designed to determine what i do well, what environment i do it well in,
it went on fucking on fucking on fucking on. microsoft trained me to
administer similar interviews in the 1990's. but since then i've come
upon the same scenario over and over: "we're fucked. we have serious
problems. can you help us?" "tell me more." "well blah blah blah." "yes,
i can help you." this was not that. i'm used to that. i'm used to
meeting some struggling manager who has a documentation problem. i ask
questions, and i determine if i can fix it. if i can fix it, they hire
me and i fix it. i'm not trying to oversimplify it... that's just how it
goes these days. whereas these people did a whole deep psychological
profile. it got under my skin. "why do you change jobs? why don't you
stay in one place?" "well, imagine if this was an interview for an FTE.
how can i talk about staying a year or two? i don't know these people! i
know nothing about them." "and you can travel." "yes." truth is,
changing jobs makes me powerful. but these people don't acknowledge
that. to them i think it's a neurosis, or at least a problem. YET
THEY'RE ASKING ME TO PERFORM 3 MONTHS OF WORK. no, they're offering 3
months to the person who is likely to consider 3 years. i never said
that wasn't me. and oh, all the "we must make order from chaos"
bullshit. how many chaos scenarios have i jumped into and started making
order? your corporate philosophy is my survival skill. you posh fucks.
the interviews are designed to surface a lot of information about my
past, and that happened. furthermore it did seem like i was spitting up
aces at least half the time. but it felt weird to have so many people
prodding around, smiling, inferring, asking more. i felt very good
throughout. it was at least a B+ performance. and fuck you, because i'm
a guy who finds work like the work you need done, and i do it well, over
and over again, in a diverse variety of environments, and i don't need a
fucking psychological inquiry. amazon thinks they're pirates in cush
offices with stupid smirks and i am an actual pirate in a pioneer square
startup during a bankruptcy with the heat off in winter so fuck you. IT
REALLY WAS FUCKING OFF AND I NEVER FUCKING BLINKED. IT WAS COLD AS FUCK
AND I DON'T GIVE A FUCK. SO FUCK YOUR ADVERSITY CHEERLEADING AND CHAOS

*Most folks seem content to let Ms. Cook stay on the board until she
leaves to join her husband, but a second issue then emerges: who would
be appointed to serve out the remainder of her term until a new election
for her position would take place in 2012? “There are no ground rules
for determining that,” said Herb Dempsey, former Bethel teacher and
president of the Bethel teachers’ union, and long-time Democratic Party
stalwart.*

I used to do Bikram yoga every day. Then like 5 years ago I switched to
a sauna and a lesser workout. And today I did true Bikram with a teacher
again. The studio is 2 blocks from my house. Now my whole body feels
beat up. Then I spent hours eating everything in sight. I still feel
pretty beat. 2nd work week starts in a few hours. settling in, gonna rip
it up.\

**Subject:** it hurts but it pays\
\
I've had a job for 7 days. I eat more, and have hot dreams while
breathing deeply. It's my task to keep the energy up, but it's also a
fact that it's up, not just in minutes but in intensity. I take home
like \$200/day. (Which I think is good.) Meanwhile my expenses are at
their lowest point in... a super long time. Today I started on a draft.
I'm a technical writer. I love-slash-fear the first steps to a first
draft. The process is alluring to me, maddening and beautiful. I am glad
I get big jobs. At least they seem like big jobs. And I get to use great
tools and techniques I've evolved over a decade. Today a guy showed me
his *dual* 30 inch monitors. Another guy saw my own rig, and at least
feigned awe. I later learned he was an agency rep, not a technical actor
in the company. So his awe might have been sincere. There is--I need to
say it--a wild beast that rips through me throughout the writing task.
Not some college certification (which I never got), but a fang-toothed
monster jaw that first locks the flesh, then rips it from bones. I
deserve (most of) my pay. (That last part is contentious, since I got
fired in the fall and then declined in a recent interview. I apparently
don't fit everywhere, especially around douchies. I'm not sure my
technique is typical, but when it becomes some issue, or my style is too
unsettling, I get fired. I don't care, because it's my sincerest wish
that the ghastly, gruesome doom that is my diction lay waste to all who
seek to write harder than me. I don't care about corporations and their
ball-licking hoohaw.) I share an office with a hard-driving mother
fucker, perhaps ten years older. If keystrokes were the whole trick
she'd be the winner. We get along very well so far, as friends and
allies. Relaxing after work is my second job and it's hard. It's going
to get harder. This fall and winter's shivers and rain. A shovel I can't
just leave at the office, cuz it's my head.\

shit's going on. i'm showing up at work, and later i'm working out. i'm
staying off coffee and kinda eating right. today for \$540 i bought a
monitor i don't really need because it's so gynormous, with so many
pixels. it's a 30", 2560x1600 pixels. i already have 3 24" 1920x1200
pixels... if you do the math, i just paid twice as much for pixels, but
if i turn it into an altogether-greater workstation design, then it's
worth every penny. maybe it will, maybe it won't. maybe it's just that
"i deserve the 5-year-old technology!" i care about stuff. i went
swimming. ny room is pretty messy and things in general seem messy but
also good. last night a mosquito bit me in my sleep and i got a big
hive. irksome! they are tearing down my house but it won't be for a year
or so. my rent including utilities is \$550 which seems darn low so i'm
glad i can stay a while.\

i'm up-to-date on Syria. it's sickening. who is your master? this is a
nation run by men with no mercy. *Yesterday, and as the Secretary
General of the Arab League was meeting with Syria’s chief tormentor,
regime thugs visited the Matar family in Damascus Suburb with the body
of their twenty six (26) year old son Ghiath. Along with the body, it
was reported; [*the thugs handed the family their son’s larynx telling
them, amidst their cries to make shawarma out of
it*](http://www.joshualandis.com/blog/?p=11924#comment-272714). Have
words been invented to describe the level of atrocious hate this regime
has for its own people? Is their mutilation of the young bodies a
manifestation of the rot that eats them? Is it fear that moves them? Is
hatred? is it revenge? Or is it simply a death wish in need of an
answer?*\

If every day's as good as this day I'll do fine. At work I played the
music super-soft when Dale was around. She didn't say anything. I had
the salad for lunch rather than the chicken rice curry. At 3pm I became
super-hungry. I might need more protein. I did a Bikram class at 4:30
and ate the rest of the evening. When I'm this active I get so hungry. I
also drank like ten cups of juice made from many different sources all
blended on ice. This is my new thing. "The United States condemns in the
strongest possible terms the killing of Syrian human rights activist
Ghiyath Mattar while in the custody of Syrian Security Forces." He had a
pretty smile. They tortured and murdered him. Small potatoes. Dime a

Minor burnout began early as I felt angry on the way into work. I've
been too high on coffee and marijuana and too low on exercise. Gonna
need to turn this clown upside down, but still some time here for
wallowing. I keepa thinking how I have a lot of stuff to take care of.
My website is full! My server won't boot! My room and house are messes,
more or less. Meanwhile I have a job slopped in the middle of most days.
And it stays until June 2012! I'm gonna yawn so damn many times! Goodbye
sun, long nights, so many bowls of cereal! But this is the big gig I've
been playing for. The first paycheck hit yesterday and it looks just
fine. I really will get an office on the water if I behave. And the job
itself is, while challenging, pretty neat. And all the other shit is
fine. My house is getting torn down, but that's like a year away,
perfect to finish this particular job, at \$550/mo TOTAL rent. The thing
is, it's not comfortable to realize everything's comfortable. Because
I'm not happy, on measure, just tolerably content and tolerably cozy.

**Subject:** some shit i wrote down\
\
I went on like two dates with someone and she likes to laugh, which
makes me funny. She's pretty, sexy, hot. But there's something I don't
get and wish I did: She talks about herself. I guess it's very, very
common... you know, the one who talks about herself? The time she X, her
friend who Y. Crap, though. It's hard to explain, but the shit drives me
nuts. Every instant is another anecdote. Is there a quiz later? And most
critically, *does this self-referential addiction or compulsion kill
something bigger that could be born?* So yeah a girl kissed me and
whispered in my ear that she's bringing me "Valentine Day kisses"
because she loves me so much. That girl is Chloe and she's 4. That was
yesterday. Today well I went sailing with a grownup and it was fun even
awesome cuz she's not a freaky scaredy cat, neurotic paranoid powerless,
obsessed man-attacking clock tick, or fumble fingers who can't tie her
shoes. Is she into her stories so much that something great dies? Am I
being a dick? I totally want her. She's super-broke. She won't let me
pay for hardly anything. Can't a guy make a deal?? But whatever, she
likes me, I like her, so play along, get all serious, spell it out. "I
think if I fuck u hard enuf maybe you could transcend the memories that
hold you trapped like a fly on flypaper. You're definitely the most
lovely lady I've dated this year. This whole theory is fucked up and I'm
making a huge mistake." I'm so hot for her u guys. Ugh. But I don't
actually want to hear all her stories. Cuz somewhere the baby Jesus dies
when u tell too many stories. But if I only fucked her hard and long
enough maybe it'd fix. God my thinking is confused. And that's another
thing. I have a great house that would make her jump on my lap but THIS
ISN'T IT. So for minor savings I'm totally missing out. Fuck this shit!
She's so much more sexy and fun than those other two. Thank goodness I
listened to my heart. And I really think she likes me, albeit she has
many friends. I could move up to cap hill. A place is available. It's
\$550 and I'd have to act now. Sadly I don't think it's gonna happen.
Ugh, what a punch in the nuts. She lives with a guy in a tiny apartment.
She's so broke. Oh fuck this fuck her I want her!!! Argh. Fuck I hate
life. through another emo day **Fuckin Update**: I asked her to come out
for ice cream but she said she's tired at home with her kitty. I'm
cat-blocked again. She said I could come over wearing a gas mask. I said
I'd like that times fifty. The ONLY reason I'm still hopeful is the cat
really isn't hers. I entertain ideas of snatching that tiny room for
\$550/mo and keeping her there as my CONCUBINE. Without some decisive
shit and luck I'm fucked. I told her I'm going to the fair. Now I can't
really contact her for a while. She's just a cute lady with girl hands
on capitol hill. She's got tons of options. Guys who jump right in with
her and the cat. NON-ASTHMATICS. She invited me but I can't go. INSTEAD
I HAVE TO ONCE AGAIN TAKE A CIRCUMSPECT VIEW AND BASICALLY WRITE HER OFF
UNTIL SHE COMES OUT TO MY HOUSE. And my house... could it be further
away? FUCKCKCKKCKC\

this is annoying. occasionally funny. i offered to buy dinner today.
guess i was turned down. she knows what i want after dinner. i offer to
pay because i have the money and because i'm very willing to spend it if
i get laid. if you aren't similarly willing to pay, perhaps i have a
minor advantage. welcome to darwinism. my only concern would be if
offering worked against my goals and this does not appear to be true. i
wouldn't want to lose out on someone i'm attracted to based on her view
on who pays. if i don't like the situation over time, i'll act. i guess
if she earns bank and never shares then i won't like her. It seems like
a simple cost-benefit analysis, with a line item for food \*cost\*. So
what's the benefit. Would u pay for dinner with Barack Obama? I sure
would. Cost vs. benefit. and also:

i was experiencing something strange on googleplus. then i realized what

sometimes idiotic, but just folk. not the highly filtered, honed,
developed, good-fit relationships of my LJ experience. not the screaming
insanity of twitter creeps and cats. and not the
oh-yeah-junior-high-friend of Facebook. just folk, being folky,
sometimes wrong, sometimes right, reminding me how different i might be
from them, or how similar, or how different experiences draw similar
conclusions. lj used to be like this, in a teen-girl sort of way, but
with the Great Fallout it's all finely tuned now. tumblr is kind of a
mute cacophony of pics you yourself didn't create. googleplus in
conversation at least has the salty taste of strangers who might or
might not be cool.
