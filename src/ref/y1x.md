### Apr. 17th, 2009 

We all played (sing, dance, clay, climb) with little Chloe 
until her bed time came and then Jenny made margaritas and 
Emily and Jenny wanted to watch girls making out on the 
internet, so we did, and then I showed them my favorite 
videos, and pictures.


###    Apr. 19th, 2009 

Today I took Emily, Jenny, and Chloe for tacos. Then, since 
it's Sunday, and it's also the day after their wedding, it's 
necessary for Mario and Soledad to party all day in the 
street. Which means 10 kids and 10 adults on the sidewalk 
with an enormous amplifier playing dance tunes, two cool 
boys playing DJ and taking it seriously. There's Coronitas 
(Corona beer in tiny bottles), curried chicken, and cake. 
The kids all got little toys today, like a firetruck for the 
boys, lip gloss for the girls. I think we're going to the 
carnival later, with bumper cars and such. Carnivals, 
circuses, and clowns are huge deals here.

I spent some quality time with Chloe, who is almost 2. I 
convinced her that I don't accept squirming or bossing around, 
and apparently she believed me today. Funny to watch her realize 
she's not gonna get away with the same old games. It helps that 
she's tired. Together we explored the house and danced with the 
chicas on the sidewalk. I was happy to re-capture the same sort 
of pleasant grownup-child vibe I used to have. We bonded. It 
requires knowing my power is strong, sincere, just, and clear, 
and then just Offering The Groovy, and being comfortable at her 
speed and in her vibe. Once you get into the kid's vibe, the 
rest is easy. I am happy I am not the daddy with actual binding 
responsibilities here, because her Terrible Twos have begun. But 
I think I could handle a year of war with a 2-year-old, without 
turning into a cranky tyrant. So long as I had some help. That's 
where Mexico far outperforms America. The whole block is 
friends, or related. The kids are always under someone's eye and 
care. In America, we've screwed up, going independent and 
individual to a fault.

Chloe is a fanatic for dancing. As are these Mexicans.

The girls (four 9-year-olds) love Chloe. They dote on her and 
take her all around the block. They prevent her from running 
into the street. I figure she's as safe as a Mexican child. 
Which is not that safe but so be it. It takes hundreds of rides 
in a pickup flatbed before you actually fall out, probably, on 
average.

###    Apr. 20th, 2009

With Emily and Jenny, showed them funny YouTubes, and we talked 
for hours.

Emily and Chloe and I ran around throwing my hat. Chloe didn't 
really have that much fun... she is so kinda wiggy, running 
away. And I didn't feel so real as anyone's closest friend, 
awkward and hot. But I used many words, and played many games 
with the girl, and it was the best fun I had in years, which 
says much about the years. I tried to teach her what shade is, 
and what sun is, and how it's cool in the shade.

I told Emily I'm attracted to her. And her daughter is also fun, 
not even two, all shrieking and barely knowing words. she adores 
me now, as i heard the birds with her, saw the flowers, played 
with her without stop for an hour, let her pet the porcelain 
dog.

I aced the interview. Then I hugged Emily, and she cheered 
sweetly for me, and we played with Chloe. And it was the 
greatest hour of my recent life, playing with Chloe, even though 
she takes a lot of focused energy. I've seen a lot of stuff, but 
I haven't seen a little baby in a while. She learns every word 
and I am the writer with the words. I don't want to feel awkward 
around Emily by making a bad move, because I am not over Akiko, 
and that's obvious. I think of being with Akiko's child and I 
forget about Chloe. Which means I'm trapped. But the thought 
passes, and I just feel sadder than normal for a moment, that 
she is not mine.

I hear birds sing, see flowers, make a picnic of a pack of 
cheese, and I'll do it with my family. But I hardly know Emily, 
and don't want to freak her out. Like her father, I'm reserved, 
cautious, and nervous. In the sun I touched her tattoo for five 
minutes, of Chloe's name around a shamrock. I told her I'm 
attracted to her. Last night in the haunted house I wanted to 
turn on her in the dark and say, "Oh, God, those aren't my 
hands!" but I'm a big safety wimp in the dark so i just led her 
by her fingertips, screaming through the haunted house. I really 
get shy and nervous sometimes.

**Update:** We walked to the tacoria, hopping between shades of 
trees on a quiet family street. At the tacoria, the man and I 
haggled and we ate. I tipped him very well ($100 pesos on about 
a $80 peso meal, plus a $5 US) and he called me his friend. I 
could tell my meager Spanish was appreciated. So was his taste 
in music, and his comfortable corner open air location, an oasis 
near my home. The drinks he offered me were Insane Sugarbombs, 
and I gracefully declined. He also pitched some sugar for the 
baby, but I dodged. And he pitched some beans and chips, but I 
dodged that, too. I raved about the music because he's got great 
tracks playing. Covers of famous 80's tunes in lounge? 
Greensleaves? The guy is on for any dude.

After we came home, I played with Chloe for an hour until she 
fell asleep. Emily laid on my arm a while and that was sweet.

Chloe is so rebellious. Her pressure to run free is constant. 
She wants to run free and shriek like a banshee, and it's just 
not possible, so we kinda battle her will a lot, and it's only 
because I'm highly amused with the job that I keep it up an hour 
if necessary, until she chills out and can relax in the hot 
Mexico sun. I'm really sensitive to temperature myself so I know 
how to stay cool... she sorta gets it, hot sun, shade, sun hat, 
but not quite yet.

Emily was a career marine (8 years) until she got ill. Now she's 
recovering and going to school. She's really pretty, with raven 
eyes and hair.


###    Apr. 21st, 2009

Chloe, Emily and I went to the park, where we rode on the swing, 
and the teeter-totter. Then we bought delicious chicken tacos, 
fresh-squeezed orange juice, and cheesecake. Chloe locked 
herself in the bedroom and fell asleep, but we found a way in 
before she woke up.

I made a slide show with adorable cats that Chloe seeks out, 
watches, and calms down and says, "Oh, cute!" We call it "Chloe 
crack".

###  Apr. 22nd, 2009

Today we didn't really leave the house, except for tacos and juice. I played on the swing with Chloe while Emily bought milk and cheese. Chloe had a pretty successful day, much more comfortable here at her new home, taking two naps without much trouble, even going to bed with ease. We enjoyed some ball kicking, some balloons, watching the monkeys and kitties on the computer, dancing to some music, and even some skat/singing/"word jazz" where the words aren't quite cogent English. She usually let me pick her up, because she has come to dig me and my whole scene of groovy discovery fun, and sometimes she climbed right up to me. Food also went smoothly, with munches on apple slices, hot quesadillas, and bites of chicken taco. And she drinks water, which used to be passe in colder climates, and spills it all down her smock, cuz it's cool. She's adjusting to tropical living. She respected me a lot more today, because now I can just say, "Oh, you want to fight with me?" and she realizes she doesn't, so she stops freaking out and lives with the options. Actually I don't think I reminded her that I'm the boss once today, while I said it like 5 times yesterday. I try not to be picky about what she chooses to do. We're just showering her with adult attention and she's feeling very comfortable at this point. Today she said "bye-dios!" again as we left the taco stand. I guess part of her improvements are my own, because I know more how to just take over and refuse to let her flip out, instead insisting that she get in my arms and calm down. She grouses about this powerful voodoo, but it's as if yesterday's mad girl craving freedom has almost totally melted into a curious and calm person who is willing to exert a scintilla of dignified effort for this whole deal called straight-shooting with grown-ups.

Sometimes when I hold Emily I think it's Chloe. I spent all day in their arms.

###   Apr. 23rd, 2009

Emily is sick with bad allergies. We had a nice dinner. Mexico discovers American hits about 10-20 years later, so we listened to some good 80's hits. Mexico also features the cover tune. Perhaps cover tunes charge lower reproduction rates. Something must explain their plentitude here. Chloe stayed with Mario and Soledad, dancing to Mexican dance pop with Fatima and her friend, and Juan Pablo, who she crushes on. Walking to the third floor at Mario's entails pretty steep cement steps with inlaid stones and random rebar on raw cement slabs where the floor was cut out. Mario made this house, and it's freaking awesome, with a secure outside shop at the first floor, an indoor-outdoorsy kitchen, a beautician studio facing the street, and up the first stairs is a bedroom and kitchen, bathroom with a fishing pole. Up the next stairs is where Mariela lives with Juan Pablo and Fatima, her children. This is the cool part of the house, with awesome views and a cool breeze. Plus the family also occupies the house next door, and is close with the house across the street. My picture doesn't do it justice. It's a great social structure, the block.

I think my host kinda explained the ease of buying ice cream as giving ten pesos to a kid who already has ice cream, and they go get it. What a country!

We went to Costco and it's the same.

I spent a lot of time with Chloe again. Emily thanked me twice for this, but I really like children. What else would I do? There's no way you can ignore a child. They try to make it impossible. Furthermore, Chloe learns every word you provide, I'm a writer, and it's our duty to bring the words.

Emily is sick and it's allergies, and it's pretty serious. I know this stuff. She has a personality like Kim Brown and Ashley, and looks just like them, also. She is tall and strong. We are totally enjoying each other's company, but I don't really know her that well. On the one hand I've known her 20 years, as I've known her whole family that long, but really I just met her 3 days ago. I see her sisters and her mom in her face and eyes all the time.

This evening I said, "Gracias, Amelio." He's a cool guy who drove Emily and me to dinner. His car is quite nice and his wife is lovely. We all dined in a groovy bar on roast beef sandwiches, nachos with chicken and cheese, and fancy drinks of many sorts. Now we have a good supply of food in the house, from Costco, including lightly sugared crossants.

We get around in a truck with a seat in thet flatbed. There's a canvas just around the seat, giving shelter, but it's a crazy ride anyway, as most of the roads in Puerto Vallarta are inlaid rocks. Certainly this makes bicycle riding more wobbly nobbly.

Emily wants to start a journal. She's asked about mine. I told her highlights, specifically her raven black hair and eyes, and that I spent all day in her and her daughter's arms. She is cute and funny. I'm listening to her cough now and it's really pretty bad. She has allergies here, and now she's getting like bronchitis from them. And it's serious. 

She said on Okanawa she was outnumbered by male Marines (like, more than 10 to 1) and that it afforded certain ready options to her. She has a lot of stamina. That would make sense for a Marine I guess.

My bed is pretty cozy, too. We put one of those toppers on the mattress and it's like a hotel bed now. I was sleeping on a hard bed and it was killing me. Exercise has helped a lot.

To my surprise, Chloe gave me a shoulder massage. She's just 22 months old, and I think I taught her some new words, including: goat, sun (and hopefully shade), and the word "yes". She kinda thought no meant both yes and no. she still does mostly.

A longtime friend has engaged a local lady. They both have children, and he has a grandchild. The families are spending a lot of time together as part of the engagement, and her extended family is large and active. I was just along for the ride, until I bonded with his daughter and granddaughter. Most of my time is with those two, acting dadly/manly. But we see our Mexican family at least every other day. And Mexicans just know how to hang out. So we get to hang out, her girls doting on the granddaughter, playing at the beach, going to a casual but upscale restaurant to bond with the cute sister/her husband who drives a nice car and seems super-sweet, or just on the shady sidewalk all evening with some Coronitas (little tiny bottles of Corona beer) and a DJ amp blasting YMCA, and other beloved songs, while the ladies dance.

### May. 1st, 2009

Mexico has great people, great food, a crazy lifestyle of improvisation with the materials at hand.

I haven't had to rely on using another language before. I've travelled but never actually needed/had the local language. Mexico is different, and I am happy to know, you know, 50 words. The whole concept of speaking another language is still sinking in... I understand that look of confusion when people don't know what I'm saying. I've had to give that look before. At the same time I'm here at the house with a girl of almost 2 years who has very similar language challenges. She learns a lot more words each day than I do!

Feeling completely looney. Listening to the birds. Crying from all kinds of things. I'm gonna snap. My eyes are so irritated. Crying is the best way to relax.

I'm so weak and so full of myself, too. At least lately. I have been a tool. Barely bangin it along. Weekends are the only grace in my life. All the rest: Strife. First World Strife.

**Update:** After some crazy laughs with Aaron and Noodle, a bath, and some sweet oral hygene (but not floss) I feel a lot better and wanna just relax as a party brews in the street right below my wide-open window. I've powered off my computers. Soon I, too, will power off.

**Let's Take Chloe to New York City**

Listen. I am mad about Chloe. I think she's super. She sorta weighs down options. But she would be with great people there. It will be great and fine without her along, and we will have a New York sort of nimbleness. But I could pay for half her ticket, because I think we wouldn't miss out on much. We could find babysitters I am sure. We could show her things like train rides over rivers and sky scrapers and street entertainers and art.

I think about both of you. In the morning I felt something touching my feet that could only be little Chloe. I don't know why anyone would leave her behind. I don't think she would weigh us down too much. And me, I have seen New York. She hasn't. So what if she's 2. She'll remember. The creaking, shrieking subway ride. I love taking friends to new places I love. You two are my friends. They're Jews. Successful and adorable Jews with a big house and healthy habits. They already have two kids who will dote on Chloe. Let's take her, ok?

![](img/monkeyrun_opt.gif)

###    Aug. 8th, 2009

I'm yawning to the first degree. Today in the morning Emily, Chloe and I went to breakfast with Melissa. I think I was tired at the git go. I sent them off on a trip and then Chloe spent the day with me. Overall it was totally fun. We watched lots and lots of *Pingu*, just laying in bed, which meant I could half-sleep successfully. I wondered if all those episodes of gibberish-talking penguins would make her eyes glaze, like I felt as a teenager after television marathons, but really they convey so many social scenes and I think she was learning. I'm not a big fan of learning t.v. shows. If they're not awesome like Pingu as legitimate art, screw 'em.

Then we went to the cafe'. She rides with me on the bicycle and everyone coos as we pass. I can't imagine a safer, easier, faster way to go. At the cafe' Chloe really wanted to play the mouse game (Mousetrap) but I know that game is not fun, so I got her to play with go pieces (black and white stones), and pencils for drawing. We also took some goofy nonsensical passes at the Sorry board game. She tried citrus tea and found it satisfying. We then ate a grilled cheese sandwich.

At home we watched more *Pingu*. Between episodes of *Pingu* she began poking me in the eyes. WTF, toddler? So I'd stop the video and hold her and demand some answers about the eye-poking, but she'd defiantly arch and parry with nonsense inquiries or distractions, or perhaps a fake crisis. None of it flew and she knew it. Eventually she stopped doing this crazy stuff with my eyes.

There were other instances where she was trying to bust my chops but generally I shut her down and now she often thinks twice. I remember delivering some swats because she wouldn't let go from the railing and it's not safe. Maybe it's instinct and I should just wait her out? Anyway, there were like 3 other swats but not tear-worthy. It wasn't that she got to the railing, but when I was pulling and telling her to let go, she had a defiant smile while meanwhile I made sure she didn't fall to her death. I guess a lot of kids try to determine which "stop" orders they will honor, preferably none. I take her aside a lot and remind her what stop means when I say it. None of these things she's doing are unusual or even rare. It's just necessary to establish and maintain authority against the enormous will to dominate adults and nullify their commands.

I tried to convince her to eat some salad, but what a whiner she became. I called her a sissy. She eventually ate a hotdog with black beans, with apple juice and finally for the evening, warm milk. At one point I busted out a bowl of assorted chips and she complimented me on my entertainment saavy.

Throughout the day I cleaned house, so her grandma wouldn't diss on me. She arrived at 9pm and Chloe's now gone.

#### Teach Chloe to use the toilet

No poops scored. I underscored the innovative Win Chocolate program, and she's really enthusiastic about the idea of winning chocolate, but she did not translate a waste signal into cocoa goodness. Instead she just dreams of chocolate and figures sitting on the toilet must be connected to that or worth a try for some other reason, which breeds frustration because no waste, no win. Pee is really the loser here, and she has no connection of pee with anything but warm diapers. A Twix awaits in the freezer.

Oh yes Chloe and I were riding from the park on 50th and Meridian, and she was laying her helmet down on the handlebars, first this way then that way... and eventually she just went limp. Yep, fell asleep on the ride home. She was stable but I didn't trust her hands to hold on so I just held her with one hand.

Chloe has picked up this whiney, bossy inflection. If you heard it, you would recognize it. A lot of kids talk like that. I can't stand it. So when I hear it I mock the tones and generally refuse to hear them. She's been a bit hard to convince, but she showed this weekend that she knows the tone well. How long before she realizes it puts me on strike each time I hear it?

It's like she's convinced life is a matter of bossing some adults around / whining impossibly / downright screaming if those things don't work. And maybe tht's why I bring her to screaming. I put her in timeout like three times for screaming. I'm sick of the damned screaming. Telling her she can scream, sure. I'll put her outside where she can scream. Yeah scream your little head off freak. Outside! She makes this face like "OMG NO WAY I DON'T WANT THAT!" and I'm like well you get to choose, scream and yeah you go outside where screaming is fine.

We went exploring for an hour while her mom studied. We went to the UW parking garage. And to the park.

Her mom wants to move to Seattle. This was not our closest weekend together. I've grown accustomed to fighting through Saturday, the fight is usually how I should commit to a deeper relationship. Except regular fights about that just make me sick. And by Sunday we have some connection and fun, but let's face it she has spun classic desperate guilt or something on me about once a week since we started dating. Sometimes I want to write a how-to guide on the most insufferable behaviors I've endured in relationships. I remember a few totally insane ladies who would verbalize an analysis of every tiny thing I did carried far into the future by scientific extrapolation, classifying as they went about whether this is cementing my place beside them forever (rewarded) or driving us to a hopeless future of aloneness (punished with bitter despairing). She's not those extremes but really she already said the writin's on the wall she ain't no weekend romance so she's gonna break up eventually. That kind of talk. Well, fine. Do yo thing.

I guess if that's how it plays out then that will be that. I'll credit her for seeing the future. But really c'mon try to enjoy what you have. So I shall and she'll walk later because stuff's not sufficient. The only proper answer to these premonitions is OK.

At the restaurant I got in trouble for stealing bacon, I guess I started scowling or looking disgusted. I was I guess. I couldn't stand the mentality that abuses me for stealing a slice of bacon. I said well if I buy the meal than I guess it's all my bacon. I guess there's some subtle angle about teaching her not to take from other people's plates, and preventing others from taking from hers. But I wanted some bacon. And I'm definitely not moving to crazytown where two-year-old people wield the chokehold on the table's bacon. It's not some complex negotiation or begging or *quid pro quo*, or even relying on the whim kindness of a toddler. It's SHARE THE BACON AND DON'T BE FREAKY ABOUT IT. I guess it hit me so low because I realized I am dangerously close to crazytown where toddlers are deified and adults lick boots even when they buy breakfast. I will not reside in that crazytown. My girlfriend's not a parenting psycho with vastly misguided child rearing views. In fact she apologized for the bacon comment. It's just the sort of thing that terrifies me, that I'm even experiencing it at all, a total loss of good sense with replacement by bad... plus shaming and mocking and disgust. I am terrified of looneys and you bet they drown in that sea of madness. when I realize I'm sitting there being derided for wanting some bacon and simply taking it, i realize crazytown is a place i must never move to.

I guess she wants to underscore how she makes me laugh and stuff and that's true, but really it doesn't feel like she should move closer at this time. Isn't this what it's all about so often? Yes and no. People pushing to move closer and reminding you of their greatness in your life... these are very unsettling signs. Just be great. Don't brag about it. I just hate when someone would "knife the baby" in that way where they have it all planned out and xyz adds up to goodbye. Ok if you're so sure then act. Or are you telling all the truth? Is there still a truth of right now? And are you really willing to choke it for some abstractions and some other levers and grips around my neck? It's kind of insulting and it makes me feel sick, to deal with that kind of pressure, because it is simply not the kind of pressure I accept now or later. My mom wants grandchildren but I want happiness.

 - Friday: Cozy, stressed out
 - Saturday: Fight, say, "You no good! I ain't sastified."
 - Sunday: Have a little fun.

That's it. That's my weekend life.

We're going to SF Tuesday to see if she has brain cancer again. But don't expect more cool scalp scars... cuz this time it's inoperable!


### Oct. 15th, 2009 

Emily does not have inoperable brain cancer. She just has a common and typically harmless scarring condition caused by her previous chemotherapy.

**darin murphy responds:**

A minor correction: The scarring is from her previous radiation therapy - collateral damage so to speak. But it is something that can happen and should pose no real problems now that we know what it is.

We are really glad that is what it is, rather than multiple tumors...

**2 hours of riding around**

Emily did accounting homework while Chloe and I enjoyed bike shopping (but didn't get one) and just exploring up woodsy bike trails around UW. Three or four times today she understood something I explained, and gave me a big hug for it. Like, I explained a few things about letters, and she understood, and it makes her so happy that she just pauses to hug me. I also explained why we weren't doing exactly what she wanted, because we got to do some of it and then had to move on, and I explained that she would need to learn to accept this, which made her super-mad, until I said she doesn't have to learn to accept it right away. Having some wiggle room pleased her a great deal, and she said, I swear, "John, I love you to death." When I can explain something she's trying to understand, and the idea gets through to her, perhaps it makes her feel connected, like she really can make it in this krazy world. She loves bike riding and it's a chance for us to explore, sing, and converse. There's no question who is in charge (me, obviously) and yet it's all quite fun, riding through empty parking lots and all around trails. I try to keep her cool at the bar in the cafe' where we eat grilled cheese. She can't get that crazy at the bar because she's up so damn high on a stool and it's like gymnastics just to stay safe up there. She didn't get that crazy today. We spent some time singing loudly. I did express that occasionally she's just raving like a bully and not singing at all. She seemed to understand this critique. She likes to yell and take over the airwaves but what's the harmony in that? In the evening, we played with hardly no acrimony, on the bean bag, playing catch, hiding under blankets, watching baby goats, and being carried/swung/lifted in the bucket. For a while we sat in the storm with her in the bucket outside. She likes being carried around in a bucket. We also pushed her in a shopping cart.

**Sexy homemaker**
  
I'm going to burnout on my birthday this Saturday. I'm excited, nervous, and stressed. I bought a red apron that looks like a halter top dress and a lazy black and red bra underneath... at KMart! It was cheap and marvelous... now I just got to find some fish net stocking and zipper boots. I've decided to go against the tradition of burning man and not bring things to trade/give to other people. I don't what I'm talking about because I've never been but it's my party that's within the party so... I'mado what I want!  


### Nov. 28th, 2009 

Chloe and I laid on the huge bean bag where she sleeps. It was dark and quiet. The last moments before sleep can feel like sleep, as big eyes make out the contours of the room. We looked in each other's eyes for a minute or more. That never happened before. I saw her trust and hope and joy for living. I hoped it never leaves.

Some people can't or won't look into your eyes. I started asking her to do it when I knew she wasn't listening to something important. Sometimes she'd wiggle for a long time before agreeing to look in my eyes. She knows there's no more screwing around when you're face-to-face and listening.

Through the gaze I saw a few of her usual twitches, leaping off toward some distraction, drama, obsession. This is a large part of being 2. Maybe lost adults are lost in the same ways. But she came back mid-twitch each time.

In the morning she blocked me from exit and demanded that I confirm I'm her daddy. I told her a few times that I'm 'like a daddy'. This time I said I'm a friend. I met her at a young age when words were dripping from her mouth and now they're pouring out. I doubt her daddy would teach her to read, or look in her eyes and see what I saw.

I kept thinking about the lame things that crush hearts and jade people to the world. I imagined her as a teen, and wondered about her gaze then, deep in the crucibles of life. I hope they never jade this graceful gaze of wonder and hope.

**This weekend**
 
This was nice, right now I am occasionally yelling at my daughter to 'go to bed!' because she insists on sleeping in my bed. So this weekend was her first sleepover, it was rather fun. We made lots of videos. Figured out my boyfriends room would be perfect for a pole, and found out that certain popcorns are very bad for you sex life. So tonight I prayed with Chloe for the first time in a very long time. It felt good. My mom's arm is getting better so she'll start work again tomorrow, I was feeling depressed when I left BF's house. I guess his enthusiasm was lacking due to popcorn so of course I connected myself with him feeling like crap and said to myself 'he doesn't love me' in a high whiny voice. sigh, get over yourself, self.  


### Jan. 15th, 2010 

on friday eve i clean the whole house knowing emily and chloe are coming to play.

**Update:** Everyone has a flu or cold. We are lounging on food. I spiked Chloe's grape smoothie with expectorant. She said she loves me, and said, "kiss me, monkey!" Then Emily and me got cozy the bean bag. We're finding it exceedingly unlikely that we'll ditch this pad. But we might check out a place with a view tomorrow. I'm now convinced that I would find a new pad, or find a roommate, and that both outcomes seem possible enough.

Chloe likes the word *language*. She describes the emerging rules around showing her panties as *butt language*. Exactly right. She ate an apple while watching me sleep. When I woke up, she told me my eyebrows are beautiful.

the child rapist is on my living room floor. he gave me the creeps from the first moment. he's got a new computer, his first laptop. he's never here, he's always there. disappeared. he's all twisted with regard to protocol, proper levels of control. his girlfriend danced in my kitchen and it flipped him out a little. meanwhile i busted moves with all three the girls. he's a bit afraid of the wild beyond. perhaps it is where he wants to rape children. and perhaps he knows he can't go there. wish as he may. perhaps on a computer, perhaps in a foreign country. everyone's been universally grim about the upside, and they're right. he won't be in my apartment. he'll be down the street somewhere. he better be present and accounted for. he better not have ideas about anything "easier" in mexico.

Hugo the fireman drove us to Las Palmas and we rappelled off an old bridge there. Below was a river with water like a bath, and we had a swimming picnic. Solidad, pictured here, brought us a cooked chicken. (You might remember her wedding, last year.) Las Palmas is a clean, pretty town with boys on horses and the largest hat we've seen so far.

**Why does Mexico dig 1985?**

In Mexico, I attended a day-long family fiesta. 100 people stood under shades eating tacos, kids in a play set or trampoline netting in 11 at a time. By the afternoon they'd developed a synch of bounces and games in the trampoline. A man dressed like a snappy Mexican cowboy told some jokes, came and sat on my lap, like we'd kiss. He led me sing some lyrics to a traditional Mexican song. He poured booze into the birthday man's mouth for 5 seconds, each decade of his 50 years. Then the American pop songs came, all from 1985.

My theory why this is: Cassettes from 1985 are now reaching Mexican countryside tape collections. Today I sang I Will Survive which is currently a big hit here. I heard Rick Astley, but not (Never Gonna) Give You Up, no, Together Forever. Of 10 American songs played, 2 were from 2010, and 8 were from 1985, including Depeche Mode.

One woman turned her hundred drained chicken eggs into crepe paper, confetti and powder smash-bombs. The children grabbed them and mashed them into each other's hair, then fetched half-broken ones in second and third rounds. Everyone's hair showed white talcum, spangles, glitter, and paper streamers. I put Chloe in a fountain pool. We took a taxi home, and I tried to ask: Why is Puerto Vallarta two half moons with a huge empty field in the middle? Something about money, he said. I didn't tip just cuz I wanted to hold a twenty peso note. I don't know why that happened. It wasn't that nice.

Chloe called it the *trampolina*, wanting to go in so badly. Some guy asked her something in Spanish, and she just said "Yes" cheerful and dismissive, "Yes, and it doesn't even really matter." like a socialite. I taught her that word yes last year! Previously she relied on No to represent both meanings, yes and no.

Emily thanked me for being a daddy. I am not a father. I'm a dad.

###    Jul. 10th, 2010 

Chloe was crying at the door, stepped to me and fell forward, fell to the floor together, fell asleep on my arm. We all laid on the floor, 
in front of the fan. We ate bbq turkey burgers. She said she missed me. She said would I help her go pee, and I said she's 3, she can do 
it, so in defiance, for the first time, she dropped her pants and peed on my deck. Then we played with a bucket of ice. She was afraid of 
the new hammock. Some girls get stuff by crying, but some girls get stuff by trying, so I taunted her from the cozy hammock, until she 
tried grabbing the frame and climbing up. So it turns out this half-moon "teardrop" hammock shape is ideal for her to climb all over my 
head and shoulders, more like a spider than a monkey. I made her wait until it was dark to watch Kipper meet a ghost. Then she said I'm 
beautiful, 4 times. At bedtime, she wanted what seemed to be open-mouth kisses. Um. NO YER BEAUTIFUL LITTLE ONE.

# See Chloe Burrito

###    Jul. 27th, 2010

Usually on Friday night, we battle Chloe to sleep (it's not that hard). She sleeps super-heavy on the bean bag by my bed. She'd climb on 
Mom who was by me and declare "Let's make a burrito!" So adventuresome. "Let's make a burrito!" That's when we are all squished together. 
Whoever is in the middle is the burrito. "Chloe burrito! Mommy burrito!"

###    Aug. 8th, 2010 

Cynthia is a girl about 12 we've seen at the park over a year of weekends. Today she saw us and brought a chair and parasol, and said it didn't fit her, and she wanted Chloe to have it.

The story isn't that, though. Just as she appeared, Chloe's cousin (age 11?) said to me, "She's B... B... B..." and then seemed to go into fits. I could tell he had tried to say *beautiful*. He made me promise to keep the secret, that she's b... b... beautiful, and I said yeah, she is. And then he tried to spit some game at the gate of her house but actually could only fall on the ground and not speak. Hmm, awkward.

Then later he tells us he wanted her address, and that he wanted to be her "grown up" friend. We said he should get to know her first. Which is hard if her beauty knocks you down and renders you unable to speak. But life's hard. Young carnal lust and mild autism! What a blend!

(It did make me think he's kind of cool, because he's in to beautiful girls, rather than killing things or punching people in the stomach, like some dumb kids.)

The other cool thing we did this weekend is make a clubhouse in my storage closet. We painted on the walls and there's a bed and everything. can easily fit 3 little people and have room for me to draw on the walls too.





###    Aug. 18th, 2010

Emily and I broke up. It was my choice. I had a long time to think it over. I realized it was not making me happier. Our values are too divergent at times, and we both have strong wills. I know Chloe and Emily are a set. Knowing I can't control what happens, I'm not trying.



###    Aug. 19th, 2010 

This will be a weekend without Emily and Chloe. My car can't drive that far right now, the train only runs weekdays, and they aren't coming up. I will keep cleaning up my stuff and building through the night.

I've been meaning to find nice stationary for letters to Chloe. Emily told her biological father that if he wanted to know Chloe, he should start by writing some letters. I've wanted to write letters to her since then.

*Dear Chloe,

Hi! How are you? I hope you're feeling fine. How are your swimming lessons going? Swimming is fun! So is playing at the beach.

I'm so happy we are friends, Chloe! I love reading books to you, and telling you stories. Sparkles the Pink Pony told me to write Hello to you!

I hope we can play together soon. You can climb on me in the hammock! Maybe we will see Cynthia at the park. Whatever we do, I'm sure we will have fun.

John

P.S. Can you read yet? Some day you can write a letter to me!*

what an outgoing person! aren't some kids shy? she's persistently outgoing. three kids a little older than her shunned her from their sand play, even swinging sticks at her, so she hung out with the teen boys, who were running onto skim boards *in the surf*. so she played in the surf. but then the boys gave her the old *hey kid, you gotta go* so she went back to the first group, and battled into the social circle. then she said she's an orphan! when we're sitting right there against the log! and the kids took her to her parents and there was a brief crisis until they saw us waving.

### Sep. 4th, 2010 

AFTER A DAY OF TRAVEL I was knocked out. at home, a discovery: adjoining tiny bedroom grants all degrees of leeway. three can lay in it, or in the big bed. and now my kitchen computer is top rate, also. the house has been vibing from http://www.ustream.tv/burningman mixed in my own tracks, dude. because it's not chopped up into anything, just a constant goo of authentic and outrageous vibe at most any volume. i almost went to Fry's to buy an amplifier but instead I have a weekend family. Chloe, Emily and I went to the dining area for the old people. Mom looked rather perky, after her triple bypass.

Chloe is sleeping in the clubhouse. there's lots of paint on the walls. We painted for 15 minutes in there tonight. I'm kind of retarded for waiting far too long to realize the coolness of the project. I've been AWOL on that one. But 4 days ago I found a lot of carpet, and now I have two hideout areas. And kalamatas, so I'll get one now.

I got a tiny refrigerator. It's packed with great food now. I turned off the cold and just leave it open and graze, it's so great.

I could have worked out this morning, and that's what made this day kind of hell, missing that. But i confirmed a theory: I can get to Tacoma without much weather extremes (cuz of the tunnel, trains, trolley, etc are all rather lovely to ride) in like 90 minutes. Emily picked me up and we visited my mom. She's by a kick-ass Buddhist temple and a mega-church called Champion.

Now I'm eating delicious grapes, called Sweet Yellow Baby Grapes, plus kalamatas raw. My computer returned to whining from the heat, it says. And the load. I also have some salmon, and healla yeah let's eat chocolate: Trader Joe's Dark Chocolate COVERED Powerberries, real fruit juice pieces made with acai, pomegraate, cranberry, and blueberry juices and dipped in smooth dark chocolate. THEY'RE PRETTY GOOD FOR YOU AND OUTRAGEOUSLY TASTY.

Update: A full bag of Powerberries gives me 120% of my USRDA of Saturated Fat! You see? Health!

### Nov. 7th, 2010

Tomorrow is Emily's birthday. She was my girlfriend, but we've been on the ropes. We're on the ropes because I can't see marrying her, and things can't just stay the way they are. We still meet up and have fun together, but there's more gloom to it. And her daughter Chloe makes me very happy. But now it's not so clear how or why Chloe will spend time with me, save when I visit Tacoma, where she lives. Her house is dusty so I can't spend time there. It's a recipe for more sadness and cynicism. Out of work, living through each week, it gets so quiet here, and I miss her. I've seen them both every weekend for at least 18 months. Each weekend now seems like it could be the last.

I always told myself Emily and Chloe are gifts of fate. When you meet someone and plan a family, one could call that the classical model, but this was not like that. And so the mismatched details didn't matter. Details don't matter with fate. You can't choose your fate, so screw the details, right?

If or when I find someone new, Emily will feel hurt. And maybe she won't have any inclination to keep Chloe and me together. So I get to lose. If the gain was fate, the loss is, too. I can't pick and choose. And as for dating, or meeting anyone, I'm dreadful at it, and anyway after all we live in Software Engineerville, aka successful dude central. So I will be alone again.

Believe it or not, I accept this much without feeling cynical. I'll go on a date or two with someone, but odds are they won't suit me. Emily will feel hurt and not wish to bring Chloe, and I won't be able to visit, certainly not the way they both visit me here, because I'm asthmatic, and so I'll be alone and lose them both, and no one will replace them.

Which is why I figure I may as well move to San Francisco. I'm looking for a place to live March through May when allergies destroy me here. I don't know if this is the year or SF is the city. I know I'm lazy and I know this plan sounds like work. Staying and getting sick alone is probably what will happen again. Strangely it only makes me a little sad. Like I said it's fate and fate has as many ups as downs, right? Ups and downs are a package deal.

**Throw a party!**

![](img/weiwei.jpg)

I've always believed in the power of joy in the face of oppression.


So does Ai Weiwei. He's a modern artist. The Chinese government doesn't like him. So they've declared his art studio illegal. So he decided to throw a demolition party.

"Many had been warned by local police not to come, but they still made the effort and enjoyed music and wine and crabs."

![](img/tablewei.jpg)

Ai Weiwei knows how to topple tyrants:

"As for what happens to the complex, I have been quite firm that I will not donate it or sell it, since the government has decided it is illegal. The government actually wants to buy it from me, but I have invested eight million yuan and the government has not explained to me why I am allowed to sell it to them if it is illegal. The complex is a good piece of art. Actually my friend has offered me his land to build an identical complex once this one is torn down."

###   Nov. 28th, 2010

Emily told Chloe I'm her dad, practically speaking, which is something Chloe already felt or wished. I never said I'm her dad, but I never denied it when she said so. (Except once, which was just the first time, when she was very young, she started raving at me about how I left her. Well I didn't do that. And I didn't know what would happen, and I didn't want her to be totally confused. So that time I told her I'm John, and not her dad.) Emily told Chloe all this because Emily isn't coming over anymore. Which means I'm now an unofficial official dad. Chloe sounded unusually serious, and said something about "I didn't know how I got here, but you're my dad and you showed me. I love you, Dad." Of course I wish Emily wouldn't run Chloe through these revelations at 11:45pm, when Emily herself is probably emotional about deciding to stop coming to see me, but whatever. Emily made Chloe without my help, and I think everyone figures everyone is better off with what we all have.

**Emily replies:** 

**Correction**

Daddy, not father.

A father is legally and biologically yours forever and ever. A daddy is a person that loves and acts like a father should. McFnord is a great daddy. He loves my daughter very much. Almost immedietly I sensed that bond.

If you see a penguin take it on a leash and scramble him. Put him in the ocean. If you see a lion take him on a leash so he doesn't go in your home. Don't run in your home. If you see another monster, kill it with a sword too! And so leave a message to John and then if you see a monster kill the monster.

New Year's Eve at Jeremy's, with a man playing a keyboard you blow into, Chloe on kazoo. Later, years later, Chloe would remember the glowing finger party favors she saw at this party.

###    Jan. 2nd, 2011 

Emily says I don't love her, and she's jealous of the fun I have with Chloe. I'm jealous of the time Emily has had with Chloe. I paid $120 to pick Chloe up at 4am in a taxi, so she could spend New Year's with me. Emily is jealous I'd do that (even though she was invited). I didn't want to be alone. Emily had some other party to go to. Children evoke passion so adults will meet their needs. I guess we can all feel jealous of that love.

Chloe spent the weekend confirming I'm Dad. We bonded a lot this weekend. I showed her this video:


insert the video

This is Kyle, taking Chloe for her first swim. Imagine you were born without your father around, but you met me when you were about to turn 2, and I pushed you in a baby carriage and spent all my time with you. This is a placid video. But I am her dad. I don't want confusion. I've already confirmed he can't even write her a letter, and I can. Some day she'll ask to see this film again. But not yet.

The day after Harry signed my new will, leaving everything to Chloe, Emily said I had no commitment. That's because Emily was mad. I don't mind when she gets mad. But I obviously have commitment.

**Chloe's 3rd bday**

![](img/bdbdmex.jpg)

On her 3rd birthday, in Mexico.

I miss her a lot. But Emily's not coming over anymore. So the pain part is here. She might be around, sure, but c'mon, she's 3. I may as well be in San Francisco. I could take a bus or a train, but I end up on busses and trains all day. She'll be around, but I just miss her all the time. So pile it on to my lifetime record of sadness and longing. It's best to just accept that people rarely get what they want. They want, and they don't get what they want, and they hurt. That's my life. That's normal. It's abnormal to let it destroy you, or to think it's unfair. It's fair. That's life.

**ignusfaatus replies:**

Emily and Chloe will be here Sunday. I'm cleaning the house. cant we all just get along?





### Jan. 19th, 2011

Chloe watched *Annie* with me. She hugged my head 6 times or so while I half-slept through the movie. I will remember these days when life is cold and I am so alone again. Loneliness is as bad for one's longevity as smoking fifteen cigarettes a day. I will die sooner because I am alone. But at least there were days I was not alone at all.

I'm sick. I think the worst is over. It has taken a toll on my sense of balance. Like, I felt lazy, I felt stressed, I felt lost. Because I am sick.

But I ate better today, and worked out, and took some asthma meds. Later I got a pizza, because I like a pizza when I'm sick.

I feel kinda goofed up. I'm hoping the virus passes and things start to seem ok again.

I'm making progress on all the stuff I'm doing.

I feel like a loser these days.

**spider88 asked:** I don't know the backstory...why is Chloe not going to stay in your life?

**I replied:** she will, it's just harder because her mom and i aren't dating. but we are still spending time together. don't know what to call it. "the last dappling rays of the improvised family unit that brought lil Chloe through toddlerhood."

I just finished a superfood bender: spinach, broccoli, tuna, soy nuts, carrots, bell peppers, blueberries (by the handful; i should just live on these), black tea with apple juice, little oranges, vegetable chips with hummus, salmon, licorice from molasses, gummi bears from fruit juice, 73% cocoa chocolate with almonds, one glass of wine. i was hungry!!! because i'm ill. now i feel alright. i shopped for more so i'm ready for a whole weekend of this.

I see Chloe once in a while. I tell her we can do anything but watch t.v. and eat sugar. What a time we have. She calls me dad and says she loves me. But she'll grow up in another city. I'll take hundreds of bus rides to see her.

### May. 25th, 2011

Emily wants to take Chloe on a road trip to California. I am a little sad because I couldn't talk her into letting Chloe ride a train with me. Sad, depressing, and dangerous, but she wants Chloe immobilized in a child seat for 14 hours. I hope she brings a sedative! I look at an outcome like that as a major failure but she clings to it like it's a great idea. So I'm working through my own California plan, which involves a lot less driving, a lot less time, and a lot more great wins for camping. All because I put train, plane, shipping, and cars on the table and mix-match-create.

Chloe made me a card. Her birthday is coming next weekend and I've got shopping to do. She asked for Pop Rocks and slushies (frozen apple juice broken up with a fork). I've got other gifts ready but will get more.

i dreamed Hillary Clinton was Chloe's mom and she and I were at a summer camp golfing.


###    Jun. 26th, 2011

i might have totalled my car.
i blame me.
the oil light was coming on,
so i checked the oil, but it was fine.
well maybe the oil pump was not working or something.

anyway, at least i stopped driving it when it started to smoke.
the smoke was white (bad), nasty smell (not antifreeze!).

i need to figure out a "terminal price".
in a way this does not indicate a dying car, because i got my warning--the oil light.
i just didn't pay attention / act conservatively which is necessary for a
1983 AUTOMOBILE.

Please forgive me, old chum.
If I ditch you because you cost more than $1,000 to fix.

Car maintenance costs me like $1,000 / year.
It's always somethin.

But zip cars are seriously under $100/day?
Well that's ten uses, less than 1 per month, if it takes all day. Which I guess it wouldn't have to.

Let's price the fix first. Then think about it.




### Jun. 27th, 2011 

Monday will be a pile of unpleasantries, followed by roller skating with Chloe. It's her birthday!

I have to go to Tacoma, find a mechanic, tow my car to their shop, and just wait for a price. If it's too much then car is dead. LONG LIVE CAR.

CARS REQUIRE A LOT.

We're getting ready for 4th camping. Without the car I have to haul stuff to Tacoma by hand. So Harry found a shopping cart, which gets my basket to the bus, and I can drag it on a rope through my one bus transfer. I like fancy tricks like this.

It happens that a good many of my camping dealios are already in Tacoma, because I brought them to the birthday party in the blown up car.

I can't control whether the car lives or dies. I'm gonna accept it either way. I hope I can find the damn title.



###    Jun. 27th, 2011 

first, my car is totalled. i'm not even gonna ask. it's just dead. goodbye, car.

i'm gonna sell it for $150, or maybe even $200.

i blame me. i ignored the oil light. i'm stupid.

second, allergies.

mine are severe. and this means a lot of crud for me. a lot of crud i can't do. won't do. know better than to do. won't go where there are cats. EVER. won't go where there are dogs. dogs i can survive a little longer than cats. won't go near cigarette smoke. won't risk eating peanuts. won't go where it's dusty, or where there's ammonia in use. and some perfumes can harm me for weeks with a single exposure.

and so what about other people?

i appreciate when people are concerned for me. i appreciate it when they think of me and make good choices. THIS CAN EASILY SLIP INTO REALLY ANNOYING MOMMY TYPE TALK OR WHATEVER. "OH JOHN DON'T DO THAT YOU'LL GET SICK" LIKE I HAVEN'T SPEND 41 YEARS FIGURING OUT WHAT MAKES ME SICK.

and as for women i might date, sadly obviously some love their cats more and so they're out. some smoke and they're out. some are just stupid or pig-headed and they are out. like, some just have to use some cheap detergent, and i should just cope? or "be careful" ? because their connection to the detergent means more than me. or the peanut sauce is so delicious. if it's so delicious, don't go to dinner with me.

basically i take *every* precaution, and since i have an engineering mind, that means stuff like HEY, NO PEANUT SAUCE AT THE TABLE, NONE IN THE HOUSE, NO PERFUME IN THE HOUSE, NO RISK OF CIGARETTES IN THE PLAN, NO POTENTIAL CAT HAIR EXPOSURE ON MY CLOTHES.

sometimes it distinctly feels like friends want to play roulette with my life. OH, IT'LL BE FINE. Like once I went to this asian buffet where peanuts were in some dishes and i started freaking out very badly when i realized i might be having a deadly reaction and the last face i might see would be this hippy i met from the Y who was saying, "oh, it should be fine." the sort of certainty one might have substituting margarine for butter, or not using original Honda parts in their repair job, this is the kind of certitude they'll use on my very life.

so... in addition to no smokers or cat owners, i allow no dummies, and no pig-heads.

the pig-heads really hurt because they think something like how i'm a buzzkill or i shouldn't be so serious.

one cat exposure can ruin an entire day or more. i was trapped in one elevator with a severe perfume two months ago and i still have medical effects. i am blessed with the intellect it takes to manage a good life despite these drawbacks. but other people hurt. their attitudes and behaviors hurt. sometimes i felt belittled or ignored in my last relationship due to my limitations, and that hurt a lot. i have no mercy anymore. no cooperation with violence. i am successful because i defend my limits with harsh severity. few things hurt more than being harmed for 24 painful hours, and then being belittled or ignored in my pain, because i'm such a loser baby. and before the harm, to have my needs or concerns (FEARS) disrespected or devalued... nobody who does this will ever be trusted and i question if i could even love them.

### Jun. 29th, 2011 

I did what I needed to do today: I sold my car. $190. They should pick it up tomorrow. I will miss that old, dirty rat.

I love an old car that runs well, but with parts that don't work. Safety matters, everything else doesn't. I love when parts break. Pieces fall off.

I glued nickels to the hood. I made a hatch window out of plexiglass. I tore out the carpet that molded when the window leaked. I drilled a hole to release water accumulating in the spare tire bay.

With cosmetic pieces falling off and pieces improvised, the thing was transforming.

Time for the next phase. I am a poster child for Zipcar. Fate just nudged things along.

I paid $1,000 each year for various serious repairs. I can shovel that much into whatever rental schemes make sense. But it won't feel the same.

I love a house I can drill, nail, gut, and paint. I love a car the same way.

It has new tires. Those alone are worth $190. But so be it. Goodbye my friend. May u deliver pizzas in car heaven.


###    Jul. 5th, 2011

in my dream i was Mister Blue, a mysterious party to a legendary series of events. i wish i remembered the events. i was all set to publish a record, even being instructed to press the groove pattern down into the vinyl disk when interest in my identity caused me to reconsider. did i want people drawing their own conclusions about what happened and what role i played?

then i was at my mom's house. all the toilets were blocked. i kept calling my friend but got through to someone at a pizzaria who said she didn't know me. i got a ride back to seattle.

this dream is about identity and authenticity but i can't remember the legendary series of events. only after i awoke did i realize i should publish as Mister Blue.

sorry about the phone calls last night. i was basically asleep but i remember hearing something. it was dark in the tent and i couldn't see any light on the phone. i'm very sorry that you worried.  
i try to "over-communicate" but i'll step it up another notch and that's fine with me. i always care where chloe is and that she is safe. thank you for 
your ongoing friendship and trust. chloe and i continue love each other immensely. she's the apple of my eye.

**Emily replies:**   

I admire your patience. I admire your loyalty and faithfullness. Thank you for being Chloe Dad. I may not always be in this mindset. But I do know that she hade more to lose than gain if I did get upset and thought about ending it. It always doesn't make sense. If that makes sense, lol. I just wanted to express my admiration for you and what you did and will continually do for Chloe. I know it will not end.  

Take care,

I visited Chloe's kindergarten and met her teacher. She visited and made friends with other kids in the apartment.

### Dec 14, 2012

Emily had a seizure while driving and crashed the car with her and Chloe inside. They are both uninjured, but Emily might have a tumor in her head again. A doctor looked and said yeah, that's a tumor, but really we won't know until they compare this scan with the previous scans. I went to Chloe's concert and she sang well but she's freaking out, from car crashes, from nightmares, from Mom in the hospital promising she won't die today. And she won't die today. But I went back to drop off her phone and the room was empty. They just moved her to another room. Ugh, scary moment. So Emily is in the hospital again tonight. Chloe is spending the night with me. She just fell asleep. I knew this might happen one day. Cuz that's how cancer works. I am the only other person in the world who cares for Chloe close to the way Emily does. Well, it's early, don't overthink it.﻿
