Dear Emily,
 
The letter could come from your primary care provider if you have been in contact with that physician and they are fully aware of your current medical condition.

Dear Emily,
 
I intentionally did not respond immediately because  I am busy with other commitments and I wanted to think about my reply. I also wanted to find out a little more about what you were thinking, hence my mail asking you the three questions. 
 
Shortly after I did your will, you had the surgery down in California. Almost immediately afterword  your dad contacted me about your desire to change the guardian provisions in your will and make John Chloe's guardian. Given how sure you were about your guardian decisions before the surgery, this represented a huge shift. I spent a significant amount of time talking to Darin, thinking about your situation and researching the impacts of the type and extent of surgery you had undergone. I also want to be clear that I communicated with your father because you told me it was ok for me to do so.
 
 It was my concern that you did not have testamentary capacity so soon after such a major surgery. I felt that, at a minimum,  (1) more time needed to pass for you to become stable post surgery and (2)  it was important to get a letter from your doctor clearly stating in writing that you had the mental and emotional capacity to understand and rationally make such a big change and important decision. Without additional recovery time and a doctor's letter, I felt it was not ethical to for me to make any changes to your guardian designation at  that time
 
I have recently spoken with both you and your dad again; before your e-mails of this last week. What I came away with was that your medical condition had gotten worse, rather than better, and you were attempting to schedule another surgery. You told me that you wanted John to be Chloe's guardian. Then a day or so later Darin contacted me and stated that you wanted to change your guardian designation to he and Mariella. I was told that John had clearly expressed he did not feel he was an appropriate guardian and did not want to be appointed. Then I was told there had been a series of discussions between you, your dad, your mom and step-dad and John over a long weekend and that, based on everyone communicating, it had been decided to leave the guardian designation as drafted in your will.
 
And now, you contact me again and, again, John's name is on the table. So here is what I believe to be the best course of  action. I am not willing to do any work on your guardian designation unless there has been a meeting of everyone concerned and you are all in agreement on who should be appointed Chloe's guardian. By everybody, I mean you, John if he's still part of this picture, your dad and your mom and step-dad. If all of you do not agree on who should be guardian, I will not make any changes unless you have a doctor's letter stating that you have the mental and emotional capacity to understand  and rationally make a new guardian designation. If you  can document universal agreement of all the involved people or, absent a universal agreement, provide me with a doctor's letter, I will help you. If you have neither an agreement nor a doctor's letter, I am not willing to make any changes to your estate plan.
 
 
Yours Truly,
 
Michael Howard

Dear Mike,
 
Thank you so much for all your work. I did notice a few changes:
1. Health Care Directive, paragraph 1 Change Andrea J Mattson to Emily R Murphy
2. Last will and testament,  section VI, paragraph 1 change 21 to 25.
 
Would it be possible for us to discuss or clarify these changes this Friday? I really appreciate your time and knowledge. 
 
Sincerely,
 
Emily Murphy

Alece,

This is the email where Michael Howard makes up some high barriers to representing Emily further. After studying this email, Dr. Natalie Dong called the relationship with Darin a "clear conflict of interest" regardless of consent, and said Mr. Howard sought a legal determination from medical experts, a problematic request.
Mr. Howard explains that Emily specified me as guardian consistently on three communications in 2013.
She has asked for me to be guardian (raise Chloe) consistently since the original will was drafted. She asked Mr. Howard, then Joyce Robson, then Brianne Kampbell, then John Sterbick, then you.
Brianne interviewed Emily extensively about her mental state, her thinking behind her choices, and whether she was under any threat or duress. 

Brianne and Joyce insisted on the Mini-Mental Status Exam, administered by Bethany Oneill, Psy.D., a Licensed Psychologist, results of which I've already sent to you.
There shouldn't be doubt who Emily chose, her capacity to choose, the consistency of her choice, and why she chose me. 

John

Hi Mike,

I have met with Emily and we discussed what she wants and what happened during her conversation with you last Friday.

The bottom line is that she would like to leave everything the way it is for now, with Donna (her mother) and Richard as the primary guardians.

Friday she mixed up names when she said that she would like John to have Chloe’s guardianship, she meant to say my name. John spent the weekend with her and made a big effort to change her mind, which she agreed to do initially.

After thoughtful consideration she felt uncomfortable that he was putting pressure on her to change things and decided that she really didn’t want to do that. I support her decision.

It doesn’t look like we need to get together or change anything at this time. I am encouraging Emily to review her current papers to make sure that they express what her wishes are, and that they include everything that she wants as well.

Thank you for your help yesterday, I hope you have the chance to get everything done that is on your plate!

## Poem of William Houts


Before the white iron schedule
which keeps me enfleshed,
before take eight at this hour, and eight 
hours on, before nose and ears 
sprouted grey like dour gardens,
I rolled through the streets, 
an inebriate duke,
drunk on the sun, and drunk 
on the rain as if I'd summoned  
 them:  Come! Attend!  Be
lightning storm or heat 
wave: be lordly, lithe and frank 
as horses, and I will ride.
I was vain as the rainbow  
then, piercing the grey 
with a sun-hero smile,
and EVERYONE basked like  
happy dogs, rubber-tongued and 
laughing.  Only a fool would 
have snickered such darkless 
days, though pathos and 
pathogen warred in his veins.
