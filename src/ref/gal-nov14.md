Give very detailed responses. In addition, please provide me with the requested written documentation.
======================================================================================================

In 2014, planning between Emily and me became verbal. Around 2013, I
began talking on the phone with a wide group of people for advice and
guidance. If you want to substantiate any details with them, I could
provide a list of their names and numbers. I could also build an exact
timeline of the events prior to 2014, and provide detailed
substantiation of my accounts stated in this document, using these
sources:

-   Photographs, including datestamps

-   Emails

-   Voicemails on Google Voice

-   ZipCar use logs

-   Orca card use logs (for Emily and me)

-   Skype logs (if available)

-   Telephone logs (available by court order)

-   Text message content logs (available by court order)

-   Financial transaction records (for Emily and me)

Chloe’s name on a clover was the only tattoo Emily had.

Provide the name, address and phone number of Joy Laydbak
=========================================================

Joy Unique Laydbak

<jlaydbak@gmail.com>

This is the best information I have on how to contact Joy Laydbak. I do
not have an address or phone number for her.

2. Provide the GAL reports from that dissolution. 
==================================================

I provided the public report electronically November 5^th^, 2014.

3. Will you be amending your petition to include Jason Dempsey as a party to the petition for custody since you have stated that he will be co- parenting? 
===========================================================================================================================================================

No. Both Jason and I reside in Jason’s house, in separate living areas.
This gives opportunities for us to share responsibilities and pool
resources, which we do well together. However, I am Chloe’s dad and
Jason is an uncle. The relationships are different and I have the final
authority, just as Jason has the final authority with regard to Epona.

4. How long have you lived at your current residence?
=====================================================

Since May 25^th^, 2014, though I also maintained the Tacoma residence
until August as a residential option for Chloe.

5. Please explain in detail where you work, when you started to work there, the name of your immediate supervisor, your income, and what exactly you do at work. 
=================================================================================================================================================================

I work at SpaceCurve, in Pioneer Square. I started working there in
early September. I report to Hans-Martin Will, Ph.D. I earn \$62/hr. My
job title is “programmer writer” which entails preparing information for
readers, including customers and potential customers, to ease their
introduction to SpaceCurve’s product, which is a highly scalable
real-time geospatial database. The information I prepare is mostly
written information, but also includes software source code.

6. Please provide me with the full name, address and phone number of Jason’s current significant other, Ms. Jones. 
===================================================================================================================

Emily Anne Jones, 360-798-3454, 16721 SE 12th Street, Bellevue, WA 98008

7. Explain why she did not provide me with the DSHS authorization, as I had requested of all individuals over the age of 11 years old that would be living with or be having significant contact with Chloe, when this investigation started? 
==============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Assuming you are referring to Emily A. Jones, this has been provided.
Until October 30^th^, Emily Jones was the care-giver for her
grandfather, who died October 30^th^. This changes her schedule, and
since then she has been here with my step-brother more often.

8. Please provide the DSHS form requested and left with Ms. Jones on 10.13.14. 
===============================================================================

Delivered electronically November 6^th^, 2014.

9. Tell me about all of the CPS allegations that you have had, to date, against yourself, give the dates, name of the person or persons that made the allegations, what specifically were the allegations, and your response to the allegations. 
=================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

CPS has investigated me three times and closed each investigation with
no finding of abuse. Records regarding the two initial CPS
investigations have already been released to you. To the best of my
knowledge, records from the most recent investigation have not been
released. I have not seen them. I have authorized CPS to release those
records to you. If you need a newer authorization form, please let me
know.

The following summarizes what I have inferred from the CPS records
and/or what I learned from CPS or through you:

Investigation 1 - January 2013 – Andrea Mattson (identified as Emily
Murphy's paternal grandmother) claimed I attacked Chloe Murphy by
shoving my hand into her shorts while we played during daylight on the
sidewalk of a residential Mexican street on January 1, 2013. I believe
Andrea also accused me of having an erection while playing with Chloe.
Finally, apparently someone at the wedding that we had attended (Darin
Murphy married Mariela Murphy in Mexico) claimed to have seen me put my
hand under Chloe's dress. As previously stated in my answers to these
statements regarding these accusations and in documents filed with the
court, not one of these alleged incidents occurred. I never sexually
abused Chloe in any way or inappropriately touched her. Furthermore,
according to Andrea Mattsen’s account to CPS, I sexually assaulted Chloe
on January 1, 2013. On that day torrential rain had turned the streets
into streams, everyone was indoors, and as soon as Chloe arrived from
spending the night with Mariela’s cousin, it was time to get in the
truck and go to the airport.

Investigation 2- January 2014 – Same accusation, same accusers, same
response.

Investigation 3 - May 2014 – CPS took action when a social worker
asserted that I had “caregiver collapse” and was concerned that I was
unable to care for Chloe Murphy. During the interview, CPS caseworker
Camille Johnston relayed the following allegations:

a.  I speak to Chloe using words that mean the opposite of what I’m saying.
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

b.  I jumped on Chloe.
    ------------------

c.  I bit Chloe.
    ------------

d.  I asked Chloe to perform a task while she was wearing a shirt and underwear.
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

These allegations added up to “grooming” to Camille Johnston, she said
in the interview. This was the only direct contact that I have had with
Ms. Johnston. She never observed me with Chloe and, to the best of my
knowledge, did not contact any of my family members or friends about the
various allegations. As you know, Ms. Johnston subsequently claimed I
was so dangerous that even supervised visits were a harm or threat to
Chloe based upon a 46-second video that she never viewed. As noted
above, it is my understanding that Ms. Johnston has since closed this
third case.

I do not know who made accusation (a) and (d), but for a time I did
speak to Chloe with a touch of satire, because she would present
fantastic and imaginatively re-engineered notions of the world that
conveniently happened to let her have anything she wanted. She’s
rhetorically very intelligent. Lampooning the presentation was
effective, and I strove not to be sarcastic. I have no recollection of
asking Chloe to do any type of task, other that probably getting ready
for school or bed, while she wore a shirt and underwear. I certainly
never asked Chloe to perform any type of inappropriate task.

I believe accusations (b) and (c) came from Chloe as relayed to a CPS
investigator, but rather than “hugging her and biting her neck softly”
when she became rowdy, I was containing Chloe and growling and showing
my teeth. This was something that Emily Murphy and I did when trying to
discipline Chloe. We called this discipline technique “time in” and
Chloe can confirm what it is. I learned it from an NPR episode where a
child with severe disconnection due to severe neglect was substantially
helped by feeling contact and connection with his adoptive parents. In
our case, we have used “time in” since Chloe was three when she was
trying to assert authority over us. “Time out” is less effective.
Instead we would just hold her and assert authority, typically with a
great deal of warmth and friendliness. The experience compelled Chloe to
“come back to reality” where she was the child and we were the parents
again.

I’ve interviewed many parents since I met Camille Johnston. Chloe
dressed as every other 6 year old dresses. My mother, with 27 years as a
kindergarten teacher, told me that children develop their own modesty
starting around age 6. No parent has called Chloe’s activities (such as
watching cartoons in her room after a bath and wrapped in a towel)
unusual or harmful.

10a.Explain in detail the alleged sexual abuse that was perpetrated against Chloe, by Ally, her cousin. 
========================================================================================================

My understanding, based on information provided by Emily and Chloe, is
that once in the attic of Donna’s home, Ally offered Chloe a “real
unicorn” in exchange for "tasting" her genitals, or allowing Ally to
taste Chloe, or both. In the other instance, a similar experience
occurred while they shared a bath. "Tasting" is the word that Chloe
used. Emily asked me to “talk about this” with Chloe, and I did. I asked
Chloe what happened, and she told me Ally promised her a real unicorn
for "tasting" Ally’s vagina in the attic. I asked Chloe what she thought
of it and she made a “yuck” face and sound. I told Chloe that she didn't
have to do that anymore.

10b. Explain to me what you perceive to be Ally’s current values. 
==================================================================

Based on my personal observations of Ally and the many comments that
Emily made about her, Ally is immature for her age and plays dumb when
she wants something. Ally cries easily and seems emotionally fragile.
She is needy, and sometimes acts silly or stupid in order to get
attention. I do not mean to criticize Ally, however, Emily was
distressed when Chloe spent a lot of time with Ally; Chloe would
regress, often acting younger than her age. Emily speculated that Ally
would one day wind up pregnant and living on welfare. Additionally, I
have concerns that Ally may persist in making inappropriate sexual
contact with Chloe.

10c. Give me the dates the abuse occurred, where it occurred, how you found out about it, what occurred, what were the consequences of the alleged sexual abuse, how old was each child at the time of the encounters? Was a CPS report made? Why or why not? Was there an investigation? What was the outcome of the investigation?
====================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

I found about the abuse from Emily and Chloe in 2011, when Chloe was 4.
I am not aware of a CPS report made about the sexual interactions
involving Ally and Chloe. Emily asked me to “talk with Chloe” about it,
and I did. In my investigation, I determined that Chloe was tricked into
having sexual contact with Ally, and that Chloe did not enjoy it. I
explained that she didn’t have to do that again. I also answered Chloe's
question regarding unicorns, confirming for her that they are not real,
and conveying to her that the incident sounded like a trick Ally played
on her to get her to do something she didn’t want to do.

11. What was the name of the individual that offended Ally? When was she offended? How did you find out about it? What were the consequences of Ally being offended? What happened to her? Where was she when she was offended? How old was she at the time?
============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Emily told me a friend of Sarah’s (her sister) offended Ally. After they
learned of the offense and of the offender’s legal status they ceased
giving him access to the family. Chloe also explained to me that there
was a man who wanted to be with children so much that he couldn’t
control himself. I believe that the offense occurred before Chloe was 4
years old. I do not know any further details.

12. You stated that Jenny, Chloe’s aunt, dated a convicted sex offender. Where did he serve time in prison? How long? What was he convicted of? Did the family know about his past? If so, how did they handle that? What is Brian’s last name? How do you spell Jenny’s last name? Do you know how I can reach her? When did she end that relationship? 
=========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

I do not know where Brian served time, or for how long. I know he spoke
in more detail to Candace Zygar about his crimes and punishment, and
perhaps he also told Jenny Kennaugh (Emily Murphy's sister). Emily
Murphy's family knew he had done prison time for offenses (more than
one) against minors. Donna Mairs (Emily Murphy's mother) welcomed him as
a guest in her house even after Jenny broke up with him. That must have
been around Thanksgiving, 2010. Jenny’s cellular phone number is:
253-548-4761.

Brian has also allegedly attempted to drug and rape her friend, Beth
Nielsen, who described this attack to me in vivid detail during Darin’
Murphy's Tacoma wedding to his current wife Mariela Murphy.

13. Describe the incident in Mexico when Brian became drunk and abusive with Jenny, and the consequences of this action. Describe the incident when he kissed Chloe and the consequences of that action.
========================================================================================================================================================================================================

Jenny Kennaugh (Emily Murphy's sister) dated a man named Brian, who is a
convicted sex offender.

In Mexico, Brian and Jenny stayed in a tall hotel by the beach. With
Darin and me present, Brian became verbally abusive toward Jenny in the
apartment. He blamed her for something in a loud and clearly intoxicated
manner. We left the apartment. Soon after, Darin told me he had
instructed Brian to consume no more alcohol on the trip. He said that
there would be more action if Darin learned of any further abuse taking
place, including verbal or emotional abuse of his daughter.

Brian was present during a transfer of Chloe from Jenny into my care in
a Seattle parking lot. Brian had driven up with Jenny and Chloe. Chloe
was only three years old. I saw Brian grab Chloe's head and give her an
inappropriate, smothering kiss in the presence of Jenny. I told Brian
not to kiss Chloe again.

I had strong concerns every time I knew Jenny put this boyfriend in
contact with Chloe, and I substantially question Jenny's parenting
judgment and setting of boundaries. I also feared when Donna Mairs
(Emily Murphy's mother) welcomed Brian into her home even after Jenny
had dismissed him.

14. Why do you believe that Donna’s daughters do not have their own free will to pursue their lives in the way that they choose? Why is it Donna’s fault, if they have not furthered their education and interests? 
====================================================================================================================================================================================================================

The idea that I find fault with Donna Mairs over something which she has
little or not control is inaccurate. Donna's daughters are adults and
responsible for their own choices. My concern, however, is that Chloe
will not be encouraged, supported or guided to obtain a college
education. My concern is based upon my personal observations of Emily
Murphy's family over the years, Emily's clear comments, and research. I
am also focusing upon this because Emily believed that Chloe would fall
through the cracks if left in the care of her biological family. I’m not
finding fault with Donna. I’m saying her emotional health, values, and
educational background are reflected in the outcomes for her children.
These facts concerned and upset Emily for many years. Research strongly
links level of college attendance with the female parent. When the
parent has not been a college graduate the gap can be closed with an
older sibling or a significant adult in the child’s life. I am and have
been that significant adult for Chloe.

15. You stated that you stopped using marijuana on March 23, 2014. When did you start using it? How frequently?
===============================================================================================================

I started using marijuana when I was 25 years old. At age 25 I had
severe computer overuse syndrome including carpal tunnel syndrome, which
manifested in extreme pain in my hands and neck. I used it periodically,
with months of cessation. Around 1999 I tried Bikram yoga, also called
hot yoga. At first it was extremely painful but effective treatment for
my hand and neck pain. In 2003 I developed techniques for working with
computers while lying down, which substantially reduced the impact of
computer use on my neck. In 2007 I began doing Bikram yoga in the sauna
at the YMCA. In 2009 I began pain treatment, rolfing, with Mark
Pearlscott. My use of marijuana reduced over the decade as I discovered
these pain prevention techniques. However I continued to use marijuana
frequently until October 2013.

16. When is the last time that you and each of the Murphy daughters use marijuana? 
===================================================================================

Times we last used marijuana together:

Sarah (Emily Murphy's sister)
-----------------------------

Sarah offered me her pipe and lighter at Dash Point Park while camping
around 2012. Sarah gave marijuana oil as a 2013 Christmas gift to Emily
Murphy and to me, but I think the last time I used marijuana with Sarah
was at Dash Point Park when she offered it in her tent where she and
Emily were getting high.

Emily Murphy occasionally provided marijuana oil she said came from
Sarah through her medical card.

Melissa (Emily Murphy's sister)
-------------------------------

I am sure Melissa and I shared marijuana in the past but no specific
instance comes to mind. It must have been prior to 2013.

Jenny (Emily Murphy's sister)
-----------------------------

I shared a joint with Jenny and Emily in 2009 in Mexico. The marijuana
was provided by Darin Murphy (Emily Murphy's father) through his wife
Mariela Murphy (Emily’s step-mother).

Emily Murphy
------------

Emily and I last used a small amount of marijuana together on or before
March 22^nd^, 2014.

17. Where and from whom did you obtain marijuana?
=================================================

Of the parties involved in this case, I obtained marijuana from Emily
Murphy, her sister, Sarah, and her father and stepmother, Darin and
Mariela.

18. Please give me a time line of all of your romantic relationships. Tell me when each one started and ended, the name of each person, and why the relationship ended. 
========================================================================================================================================================================

Emily Rose Murphy
-----------------

2009 – 2011, 2013-2014. I began dating Emily in 2009. We were apart for
a while, particularly during the time that I was dating Melissa
Burchett, but experienced a significant shift in our relationship in
2013. Emily asked me to move in with her and to be her "last boyfriend."
Emily was a fierce, funny, and beautiful person. We fell in love unlike
any I’ve felt before. The relationship ended with her death, but often I
think it’s still with me strongly. I remain committed to her and to her
clear wishes.

Melissa Sue Burchett
--------------------

2012 – 2013 Mel and I dated for about a year. Mel kept breaking up with
me every few weeks, and then changing her mind. She correctly identified
that I loved both Emily Murphy and Chloe, which I believe threatened
her. I initially ignored that rocky stuff, but it all got to me
eventually so I ended the relationship.

Akiko Oguchi, R.N. 
-------------------

2004 – 2008. I was involved with Akiko during her 4-year nursing
training at Seattle University. Our relationship ended because we were
unable to get past barriers to openness, many I attributed to cultural
differences around openness. I went to Mexico to get free of the memory
of her. That’s when I met Chloe Murphy.

Roya K. Naini
-------------

2002 – 2003. Roya is a pinball champion. While I dated her, she started
a punk rock band. She likes making analog photography and creating
music. I think she just grew out of me.

Jessica Benezra
---------------

2001\. Jessica taught second grade. I met her the same day I decided to
leave Brooklyn, New York. I spent two months with her. Jessica
considered moving to Seattle. However, Jessica is Jewish and would miss
her family.

Ashley Balabanoff
-----------------

2001\. Ashley lived in Brooklyn, New York. We dated while she studied
acting. Our relationship ended when I had to return to Seattle.

Anja Winter
-----------

1998-1999. Anja was an *au pair* from Germany on assignment in Seattle.
She had to return to Germany, and I visited her in Berlin. We did not
pursue a long-term relationship due to the obvious issues of distance
and time. We correspond occasionally.

Dawn Michelle Devine
--------------------

1997, 2000. I dated Dawn during three separate periods. This was not a
serious relationship.

Dena Reaugh
-----------

1991\. This was not a serious relationship.

19. Give me a time line of when you started to have a relationship with Ms. Murphy, when it ended, when it started again, and the dates of when and where you and she co-habituated with one another. Please be very detailed. 
===============================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Dated Apr. 17th, 2009 to Jan. 11th, 2011, then July 4^th^, 2013 to June
1^st^, 2014.

Lived as a family December 24^th^, 2013 to May 15^th^, 2014.

20. Please explain, in detail, all of the time that you have spent with Chloe, from her birth, to present. Please state when Ms. Murphy was present during these interludes.
============================================================================================================================================================================

This question is overly broad. I have known Chloe Murphy since she was
22 months old, which is now well over five years. Nevertheless, I will
do my best to summarize my numerous contacts with Chloe and her mother
Emily Murphy.

When I dated Emily Murphy, we three would be together almost all
weekends. Emily kept clothes, a toothbrush, and other items at my house
as we both looked forward to time together and rarely missed it. We were
together through two trips to Mexico (each over a week), and one trip to
New York City (over a week). We spent all major holidays together, often
visiting her mother and my own in the same day.

Even when I dated Mel, I invited Emily and Chloe to family events, such
as Thanksgiving, 2012. Emily and I maintained a commitment to being
Chloe’s parents and being each other’s friend. Emily and Chloe always
camped one or two nights with my family on 4^th^ of July, but when I
dated Melissa Burchett in 2012, Chloe accompanied Melissa and me to the
family holiday campout. Once Emily couldn’t accompany me to Christmas
Eve at my sister Jan Dempsey’s house, where we always spent the night,
so Chloe accompanied me without Emily. We attended three birthday
parties for Epona (my niece) at Gasworks Park, but once Emily missed it
on one occasion while Chloe attended.

A very common routine would be for Emily and Chloe to spend the weekend
with me, and then Sunday night we would all visit my mom, Jeris Ockfen.
We probably did this 30+ times together over the years.

When Chloe was 3, I began video-chatting with both Emily and Chloe on
Skype. Through some periods Emily would call me every day after work so
I could talk to her and Chloe. When Emily and I stopped dating, we would
all still talk on Skype. We would coordinate visits to Seattle for Chloe
to spend time with me. Chloe spent a few nights at my first apartment,
where she had spent a year with Emily and me. Then I moved to a small
apartment on Capitol Hill, where Chloe also visited and spent the night.
Chloe developed relationships with two other children in the building,
and I would take all of them to the park, both with and without Emily
present. I estimate that I spoke with Chloe at least 20 times a month,
visited her at least 4 times a month, and coordinated an overnight visit
at my apartment twice a month.

In 2013 my relationship with Emily returned. I believe their first
return to Seattle together was March 30, 2013. In April Chloe was with
me at my half-brother’s wedding, and that was her first visit to the
improv singing group where I would take her with and without Emily at
least eight more times.

My romantic relationship with Emily resumed July 4^th^, 2013 during our
family camping trip. I spent time with them both throughout the summer
of 2013, nearly every weekend. I always believed in making people travel
the least, and Emily went through a tough phase in early 2013 with
limited mobility due to weight gain from heavy steroids. So I would take
a bus or ZipCar to Tacoma, then take Chloe to the Kandle Park wave pool.
Emily was usually with us during these swimming visits, but Emily did
not swim. I would swim with Chloe and then visit with Emily, who would
sit in the shade and snack on fruit, juice, etc. That is when Emily
began asking me to move to Tacoma.

By October, 2013 it was clear Emily was deteriorating as she became more
tired. Logistics of getting around became more complicated, mostly due
to fatigue. We tried to make the best of the facts. Frequently she would
come to my apartment by bus, relax and sleep, while I would take Chloe
for a walk, or we would meet up with four different neighbors in our
building, two with children her age, one who played many instruments,
and Daniel Masler, a child psychotherapist. Emily would have some energy
to walk a few blocks for some Mexican food. Then we’d all come home and
go to bed for the night. The next day we would make a short family trip
to a fun place such as a park, and then perhaps downtown to the Tacoma
bus. Sometimes Chloe would stay another night. It was all figured out on
the spot, based on Emily’s wellness and energy level, and other factors.

I have always communicated to Chloe that I value serious studies, so I
always came to school open house for pre-school, kindergarten, and first
grade, and other events (“Dads and Dogs,” school musical assemblies,
award assemblies, “Math and Book Night” during 1^st^ grade). I was with
Emily most of the time at these school events. Starting January 2014, I
became Chloe’s sole transportation to and from school, and primary
representative with her teacher and guidance counsellor. At that time
Emily became so tired that I was the primary care-giver for them both,
doing my best to keep the household together, but always deferring to
Emily, and showcasing her, because I knew these times would be Chloe’s
last memories of her. I was the day-to-day care-giver, while Emily was a
special person with whom we tried to share special moments, singing,
playing badminton in the house, eating the dinner I cooked, and just
being together whenever she had energy.

Another way to answer this question is to note memories of places where
I was with one or both of them. Emily said regularly that memories are a
critical part of a good childhood.  I strove throughout Chloe’s
childhood to expose her to places and experiences that interested her. I
find these memories coming to me everywhere I go throughout Seattle, and
it’s often easy to remember whether Emily accompanied Chloe and me.

    January onward, I took Chloe to and from school, provided some
    after-school play opportunities, and cooked almost all meals. I

21. Describe in detail about what you know about Donna and Darrin being engaged in group sex or the exchange of sex partners and drug parties in the 1980’s. How long did this type of lifestyle occur? How and when did you become aware of it? Please give me the names and phone numbers of the individuals that told you about this.
========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

I learned this from William Houts, Emily’s friend Allison, and from
Donna Mairs.

William Houts (253-582-4763) relayed to me that he walked in on Donna
having sex with his boyfriend around 1988. Donna invited Mr. Houts to
join in.

Allison (253-279-7250), a childhood friend of Emily’s, was prohibited by
her parents from visiting the Murphy home due to what she described as
an “anything goes” philosophy. I don’t hold this view. Instead I saw a
strange mix of strictness, social insularity, and party activity.
Allison told me that LSD parties and sex parties occurred.

When I was about 22 Donna typed to me in an erotic way using a
computer-to-computer interface.

When I began dating Emily, she lived with Chloe in a small apartment.
Later she moved in with Donna and Richard to save money and get some
help with Chloe. I was reluctant to visit Donna’s home because it seemed
Donna didn’t like me. Donna called me and explained that she knows I saw
her do “immoral things” in the past, and she felt ashamed. I said I do
not recall seeing her do anything she might consider immoral.

Around 1992 Darin hosted parties where young people he knew would drink
and party. I saw a young, drunk woman (Kim Swanson) who might have been
under 21. Darin assured she laid correctly so she would not drown in
vomit. I don’t know where she acquired alcohol.

22. Describe in detail what you observed and know about the strip club that you and others attended in Mexico. 
===============================================================================================================

The strip club’s name was Hysteria. It is a known tourist destination in
Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. The dancers performed one at a time on a
catwalk while staff pushed overpriced drinks to intoxicated Americans.
Then performers offer to dance in laps in exchange for bracelets
purchased on the customer’s tab. I would describe it as dimly lit. Darin
Murphy (Emily's father) made arrangements for some of us to go to
Hysteria. Darin took us to the club without warning. I had never been
there. Darin told me that all dancers in the club sold sex, even those
who say they do not. I don’t know if Darin had been there before. He did
say he had been to the “local” strip bars in Puerto Vallarta, which he
characterized as friendlier than the tourist-oriented Hysteria.

23. Describe in detail the interaction of Darrin and his fiancé with the strippers, while in Mexico prior to their wedding. How old were all of the participants? Who else was present? Where were you? Who arranged the outing? Why did you choose to attend? Who cared for Chloe when you were in attendance? What did Darrin’s future spouse say about the event? 
=====================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

While at Hysteria with Darin Murphy and the other members in our group,
I sat in a chair at the end of some small drink tables. A stage was to
my left, along the left side of the little tables in front of me. Along
the right side of these tables sat Mark Deutsch, then Melissa Vulliet,
then Rob Vulliet, then Mariela Murphy (Darin's wife). Darin Murphy sat
in a chair you might say was at the other end of the tables,
face-to-face to me but at some distance (the distance of four adults
sitting side-by-side).

I saw Mariela and Darin engage in sexual contact with at least two
strippers/prostitutes ("entertainers") while drinking distilled alcohol.
Darin kissed and touched at least one stripper all over, who kissed and
touched him all over .Darin's third daughter Melissa and her husband Rob
also employed entertainers for sexual contact while drinking distilled
alcohol. I did not engage in sexual contact with any entertainers or
drink alcohol. Darin brought us all in the same vehicle to the club
without warning. I would not have joined if informed of the destination.
During the evening I only practiced Spanish with the entertainers I met,
and provided modest compensation for their time.

I estimate all participants to be in excess of 20 years of age. The two
I spoke with were single moms. Chloe stayed with Mariela Murphy’s family
while we were away. Darin Murphy said later that a stripper he hired
there asked for 25 (pesos or dollars) to get cocaine. He told us that he
declined. Mariela Murphy said to me later that extramarital sexual
relations were ok with her so long as she remains the primary partner.

24. Describe in detail Darrin and the physical punishment of Chloe in Mexico.
=============================================================================

Darin's current wife, Mariela, is from Mexico. Chloe danced at a party
celebrating the wedding of Mario and Soledad, Mariela’s parents. Chloe
was not yet 2 years old. She danced so hard that her skin was chafed by
friction from her pants and diaper. Chloe cried in the car as we drove
home from the party. Darin drove. Emily, Melissa, Rob, and I were
passengers. Chloe would not stop crying. At that time in her life Chloe
was barely verbal, so we did not know what was wrong. Darin stopped the
car and spanked Chloe hard, causing her to cry much more loudly. Later
we determined that Chloe was crying because she had chafed, irritated
skin. During a car ride in Tacoma years later, Darin again threatened
spanking to gain Chloe's compliance.

25. Tell me all that you know about Darrin Murphy.
==================================================

This is a very broad question. I’ve known Darin Murphy (Emily's father)
since I was a teenager when we both ran our respective bulletin board
systems on computers in the mid-80’s. I then was his personal assistant
after I graduated from college, in 1993. I looked up to him as a role
model and friend, and he taught me many of the skills I still use today
in my career. So, so my answers could go on for a book. I’ve tried to
focus on things I know that seem related to this investigation.

I know Emily Murphy said these things about her father, Darin Murphy:
---------------------------------------------------------------------

-   “I want to give you everything you could need to keep Dad from
    interfering with the plan for Chloe.”

-   Emily told me Darin carried on sexual relations with both Donna and
    Dina (Darin’s second wife) in the same period of time.

-   Around January 2nd, 2014, Darin rang Emily’s phone and mine
    after bedtime. He refused to communicate via text. He explained his
    car was in the shop, and he needed to borrow hers. She cried as he
    drove over, and said, “He thinks he can just show up. Then he can go
    back to his family. It’s not fair.” I held her to comfort her.

-   The second time she cried, her father had taken her for a drive.
    During the drive he explained his view that she was being abused.
    She came home and began crying when I hugged her. She said, “I like
    how we talk about our feelings here.”

-   Darin is very charming to strangers. In Madigan hospital, as Emily
    and I tried to get a urine sample, we listened to Darin charm an
    old man. This annoyed Emily, because she sensed the friendliness was
    all contrived. Emily had an attraction to authenticity and
    the truth. She said “You never get to know what Darin really thinks.
    He only shows you what he wants to show you.”

-   She made a rule that we were not to discuss her father in the house.

I know Darin Murphy said these things to me:
--------------------------------------------

-   “I felt manipulated.” –This was Darin’s response to the meeting at
    Howard Dempsey’s, suggesting I should feel guilty. Guilt is the
    family national anthem. In that meeting, Emily and I floated the
    idea that Darin and Mariela raise Chloe. At that meeting, at the
    end, Darin asked, “What’s in it for you, John?” This seemed like a
    strange question to me. In a previous interaction he had already
    agreed that there are mental health problems at Donna’s home. I
    wanted to help Chloe reach a safer, healthier environment. What did
    he think my motive *might* be? Of course in his declarations he
    argues that my intention was to secure access to Chloe so I could
    sexually victimize her.

-   “This elevator is inadequate for Emily’s needs.” - Suggesting I
    should defer to his authority on adequacy of elevators. He said we
    should move.

-   “I want her to have some comfort. I’m supporting my daughter! What
    are you doing?” - Suggesting I should feel guilty and that he’s the
    righteous one. Actually this is his only statement that had an
    impact on me.

-   “You’re paying a pretty penny!” - Suggesting I should defer to his
    authority on real estate rental rates. In fact, the rent was not
    high, was stable (all utilities except electricity included), the
    view was lovely, and the location was about as convenient and fun as
    Tacoma gets. Emily paid less per month than she paid to Donna.
    Square footage is simply not the only way to think about
    real estate. Emily said about this comment, “Where was he when we
    were looking for a place?” He was in Mexico. After we had signed a
    lease, he appeared to want us to move, for reasons I do not think
    related to his stated reasoning. Emily was proud of our apartment
    and we adults chose it well.

-   Once in Mexico I paid for everyone’s meal. He said, “You’re a good
    guy, John. Others might not know it, but I know it.” He ostensibly
    was kinda joking, but it seemed like a strange, demeaning statement
    masked as a joke. I had, after all, paid for everyone’s lunch.

-   I know he was willing to disregard Emily's clear and consistently
    stated wish for full resuscitation and life support. He described
    this change to me as being "easier for the family, including Chloe."
    He also justified this to my father and step mother in a conversion
    for which I was not present.

-   On two occasions Darin described Andrea as being “manic”. Once she
    was making urgent requests for food or cooking purchases that Darin
    would not satisfy, because she was being “manic” in his view.

-   Darin sought Emily’s cellular phone one week before her death. He
    said this was “in case her friends call”. This did not make sense
    to me. Emily had stopped answering her own phone regularly over a
    month prior. Her friends would just call me. I had referred them all
    to Mariela’s phone. So what friends was he referring to? How would
    she answer? As well, I knew her phone was an authentication key to
    her financial, social, and personal accounts, such as email,
    Facebook, and Tapco. She had entrusted me with her finances and
    email as her Financial Power of Attorney, and as the Executor of
    her Estate. It was not financially prudent to release this
    authentication key to any other party for any reason. I explained
    this position twice. His response was: “John! John! Her cell phone
    is her cell phone!” He then hung up as I responded politely that the
    device would not leave my custody. He continued demanding it in
    person, using notes. Had she sought to entrust her finances and
    personal communications to him, I imagine she would have placed him
    in these legal roles, or provided him with passwords. Based on his
    hostility and my understanding of Emily’s friendships, I doubt his
    stated motive—that friends might call. Call forwarding could solve
    that problem, for example.

-   Darin told me his second wife stole from him (\~\$100,000) and he
    worried she was plotting to kill him, so the family of his third
    wife asked if he needed her killed. He said he declined.

-   -   -   

I have observed these characteristics or deeds of Darin Murphy
--------------------------------------------------------------

### Deeds

-   Emily often cried after speaking with her parents. While crying
    after interactions with them she said:

    -   “Exhausting.” (after speaking with Donna)

    -   “He thinks he can just show up. Then he can go back to
        his family. It’s not fair.”

    -   “I like how we talk about how feelings here.” (after a car ride
        with Darin where he asserted that she is being abused.)

-   Once during a visit to Darin’s home, probably Emily’s last visit on
    her own two feet, I read a book to Chloe while Darin worked on some
    computer task. Mariela asked him if he was sure he wanted to work
    rather than just talk to us. He worked instead, sort of talking
    while he worked, and drove away to deliver a package at the FedEx or
    UPS office. Emily commented later that Darin didn’t notice me
    reading to Chloe, and this seemed to make Emily angry or disgusted.
    I think she tried hard to make her parents understand and accept her
    choice regarding me and Chloe. She would note with disappointment
    every time I was obviously doing healthy things with Chloe which
    they (especially Darin) didn’t seem to see.

-   Darin claimed both Emily and Chloe were experiencing abuse, and he
    worked two blocks away from our apartment on Tacoma Avenue, yet he
    rarely visited for months.

-   Darin says severely critical things in meetings that he does not say
    in private, one-on-one, conversations. Many times he had a cheerful
    conversation with me one-on-one, and the next day (or hour) severely
    criticized and accused me in a meeting of authorities. He never
    discussed his serious allegations against me with me, perhaps
    because he knew they were fabrications.

-   Once I made him laugh. It was after he made the far-reaching
    allegations at the second adoption meeting. He asserted that I don’t
    sleep with Emily, in her bed. Soon thereafter he was at my house,
    and I explained where I sleep, “contrary to popular myth.” This made
    him laugh, I believe because he knew his claim was a fabrication.

-   Darin is charismatic and can read people.

-   Darin never used the call box. He always snuck into the building and
    arrived at the apartment door. He rarely called ahead, and never
    called me, even though I was Emily’s care giver.

-   When Emily relocated, Darin prepared a POLST (Physician Orders for
    Life-Sustaining Treatment) form that specified no resuscitation
    efforts to be made (Do Not Resuscitate, DNR). A POLST form is not
    valid unless signed by a physician. I only saw the unsigned POLST
    hanging in Emily’s room. The signed form was hidden under other
    papers on the kitchen refrigerator. Emily confirmed with me many
    times that she wanted all forms of life extension and resuscitation.

-   During a trip to San Francisco paid for by the Wounded Warrior Fund,
    a private fund for injured marines, I bought everyone's lunch. Darin
    asked for the receipt because the fund would compensate him. This
    was theft.

-   At Emily's internment Darin shook hands and asked my older brother,
    "you are John's brother? I hope we can put this family conflict
    behind us." His activity in court showed no intention of doing so at
    that time. My brother said his name and Darin shook his head as if
    the name was unimportant.

-   At the 2^nd^ adoption meeting, Darin interrupted my sister to object
    to the tone of her voice. My sister is very level headed,
    reasonable, and considerate. She is a project manager for a
    multinational corporation. Darin often employs various techniques to
    attempt to control meetings. He will be totally cheerful one on one
    and vicious in a meeting moments later. All of his behavior is an
    act intended to control others. Nothing is genuine. This is
    consistent with Emily's view that her parents are “fake.”

-   Darin reached a rank where he was the commander of fire stations.
    All personnel in the station were under his command. Then he
    switched to answering 911 calls. He is highly ranked in seniority
    and presumably draws a high salary. it is suspicious that the
    department now employs him to answer phones as a dispatcher.

-   Based on his declarations I believe he is willing to mislead
    the court.

### Relationships

-   Darin said his 2^nd^ wife Dina isolated him and he believed this was
    what Emily was experiencing. But it didn't inspire him to come over.
    I have many photos of Emily with friends during this period.

-   Darin described his second wife Dina as controlling, and said she
    isolated him from friends and family. Emily confirmed that she
    prevented Darin from attending the wedding of Sarah and Greg. Darin
    showed an example of a photograph where she had cut Donna out of a
    picture where Donna posed with her daughters.

-   Dina was angry with Darin for watching pornography. She believed he
    needed therapy to cease this pattern. He disagreed.

-   Darin discussed the availability of hit men in Mexico, where he
    owned a time-share condo in the more-American part of town, north of
    Puerto Vallarta. (Nuevo Vallarta.) He called his condo and someone
    answered, which was unexpected. Darin believed his wife to be
    ruthless and greedy, and he believed his status as her spouse might
    incentivize her to have him killed so she would receive both assets
    and fire department pension. Some member or members of Mariela’s
    family reportedly asked if he needed to have someone “taken care of”
    and he declined this offer. Darin explained that Mexico is a place
    where people just “disappear”.

-   Emily was Darin's favorite daughter. He worked hard to get her to
    surgery in San Francisco many times. I often reflected that she’s
    the most beautiful woman who ever loved him.

-   Darin associated with Ted Fix, who was convicted and imprisoned for
    modifying and selling firearms in an unlawful way.

-   Donna complained to me when I was about 21 that Darin did not spend
    adequate time with his children, and asked me to discuss it
    with him.

-   Darin maintained sexual relationships with both Dina and Donna in
    the same period, according to Emily.

-   I heard Darin say he loves Chloe once, in 2009.

### 

### Weapons

In the past Darin Murphy had an extensive cache of firearms, knives, and
NATO-issue night vision binoculars. When I worked for him, I believed he
was armed adequately to outfit a militia. He stored these weapons in his
attic office, which was frequently unlocked. I do not know if the
weapons were loaded, and never touched them.

Darin was a member of the Washington State National Guard, where he
maintained skills as a marksman.

Darin owned property in rural Piece County where he fired guns and
detonated explosives.

### Relationship with Kyle Coker

Darin and Kyle Coker had no previous association that I am aware of, and
Kyle expressed hostility toward him in my conversations with Kyle.

Kyle identified in court that Darin was planning to host him for a visit
in late August. Heather Young asked Commissioner Johnson if he would
like to hear from Darin about the plans to host Kyle.

26. Do you believe that Chloe should have unsupervised contact with Darrin Murphy? Why or why not?
==================================================================================================

Yes, but with substantial reservations. Chloe does not show an interest
in Darin Murphy. Furthermore, I personally agree with Emily that Darin
is emotionally very damaged. He uses impressive charisma to persuade
people to believe, help, and follow him. I watched him organize a
massive smear over many months to control both Emily and Chloe. Emily
said many times Darin has no relationship with Chloe. Emily just saw
“grumpy grandpa,” as she put it. I believe he’s utterly untrustworthy.

I believe Darin might spank Chloe painfully just to show her how much
pain is available from him. I believe he is abusive due to a twisted
psychology of control and egocentrism. But I believe he would need
actual custody to do substantial harm to Chloe.

27. Describe in detail why you state that you engage in “play therapy” with Chloe during your encounters with her.
==================================================================================================================

Play therapy is one of the ways that I engage Chloe. I have prepared
Chloe for her mother’s death and her bereavement for a long.
Specifically I prepared her to accept me as her new primary care-giver
by strengthening our relationship. I wanted her to understand she had a
non-judgmental, committed, unflappable adult in her life who puts her
first and accepts her as she is.

I am neither a professional educator nor a professional therapist.
However, I reflected on the purpose and focus of my relationship with
Chloe over the many years it has evolved. Ultimately I embraced the
necessity that I must maintain a strong, healthy, ultimately parental
relationship informed by my experience and understanding of her
emotional needs.

I have exposure to theories of personality development and fundamentals
of therapy through university-level study, personal relationships with
therapy professionals, and professional relationships with therapists
and counselors who understood Chloe’s needs during Emily’s illness and
Chloe’s parental bereavement. I also have hands-on experience with
children, including children with special needs, including academic and
volunteer engagements at all age levels.

The more kids can play in their lives the more they can be kids. Of
course that may overly simplify the rather technical therapeutic meaning
of the term "play therapy" but it implies that I’m willing to let kids
express themselves as kids while I get to be a part of their world. When
possible, they get to set the terms of the playing.

A lot of intention has gone into my relationship with Chloe. It is very
naïve to see my “playfulness” as irrelevant to Chloe’s emotional needs,
and both playing and therapeutic play are not the only ways I relate to
her. While not a professional therapist, I put a great deal of thought
into my approach to Chloe, with special emphasis on her emotional needs,
and with focus on building a relationship that would help her weather
the painful experience of losing Emily.

28. Define “play therapy” and what it means to you. 
====================================================

Play therapy uses play to communicate with and help children, especially
those experiencing psychosocial challenges. In Chloe Murphy's case, she
recently lost her mother and has had only limited contact with me, the
only father she has known. Children are unique from adults in that most
children understand play intuitively, while adults are often alienated
from their own impulsivity and playfulness by “socialization” into
“responsible” behavior. Children tend to reveal exactly what’s going on
in their mind because the window into their mind and soul is unfogged
and clean as they engage in play. It just takes some observation and
provision of symbols they can work with.

I group play therapy into different forms.

**Play Therapy:** Least structured. The younger the child, the more
straightforward the symbols are. Mom, dad, me, home.

**Art and Music Therapy:** More structured, more dialectical, more able
to draw on cultural signposts such as existing songs.

29. Explain why this is the way that you choose to engage with Chloe. How long have you employed this style of encounter? Is (are) there any other ways that you choose to engage with her? If so, what?
========================================================================================================================================================================================================

In addition to play therapy you also have a particularly useful tool in
your ability to simplify complex intellectual notions into a very
systematic concrete and sequential dialectic. You can restrict the
vocabulary but still follow the Socratic methodology to where you're
particularly effective. My mother tells of taking the kids to
kindergarten and how I was the only one of her three children who ever
really entered into the teaching process. My Dad remembers a talk with
Kenn Robinson, years ago, where he was teaching computers and I had
already taken programming classes at Pacific Lutheran and I was now a
student teaching his students. Robinson was absolutely impressed with my
ability to reduce complex and interrelated concepts to junior high
school kids in junior high school language.

From my Dad, “I've watched you engage with Chloe as a caring parent
while she simply sat on your lap and felt secure and then she would
probably jump up and go off and create another situation, exhaust its
potentials and herself, and come back and sit on your lap and recharge.
I don't find it much different than thousands of engagements with
thousands of kids by thousands of parents that I've observed over a very
long time. You like to cook together. She loves to cook mushrooms and
corn and stuff. Is that an engagement? Of course it is.”

During the visit you observed, I would describe interactions as
unstructured play. Certainly you saw interactions and positive
reinforcement, and just plain encouragement and positive support. You
saw me explaining how pool is played, and you may have noticed how
little I care about playing “right”. I do introduce Chloe to rule-based
systems like chess, pool, golf, math, bowling, and other systems. Those
interactions do not emphasize her emotional health. When I let her
change the rules, that’s when the relationship enters into an area where
she can more easily reflect on her inner dialogue and solicit or receive
my responses. I spend a lot of time encouraging her and exposing her to
math and the sciences, where there are known answers to discover which
describe the outside world well, rather than describing her inner-world.

I am also an authority figure. When I instruct her to relinquish her
golf putter rather than wielding it like a weapon, or set boundaries
about climbing on things in a fun-plex, or choosing food that won’t make
her flip her lid, I’m being an authority figure. It’s likely Chloe will
have a rocky relationship with authority figures based on her
personality and history. Knowing this, I maintain both the emotionally
empathetic relationship as consistently as the authority relationship,
while maintaining the “teacher” relationship so she has healthy things
to focus on and learn about, almost as a distraction to her rage.

I’ve noticed within the context of supervised visitation and ongoing
alienation efforts by Donna Mairs that Chloe has moved more explicitly
to the “make-believe” world to express and explore herself. For many
visits she was adamant and explicit about wishing to reside with me in
Seattle. Then I believe Donna Mairs discouraged her from these explicit
expressions, so she made them subtler in play. In the November 1^st^
visit, she drew a floor plan for the house where she wished to reside,
which included a room for me and one for her. But on June 20^th^ she
created a beautiful sand sculpture with adorning shells and seaweed
attire. She then aggressively destroyed the sculpture while explaining,
“The queen died, the castle fell, and the king and the princess were
blasted apart.” Whether this is intuitive play or subversive
representations doesn’t matter. It’s her inner dialogue with obvious and
clear meaning. It is the central concern that permeates all of her
thinking, both imaginative and concrete.

31. What manifestations have you uncovered in the play therapies that are complex and painful to Chloe? Describe in detail these incidents and when, where and why you believe this happened.
=============================================================================================================================================================================================

In two recent visits (October and November, 2014), Chloe as a princess
endlessly striking down warriors. It's her attraction to this play that
stands out. It was a bit sweaty and unpleasant for me to dance around
and get whacked with a plastic sword but she didn't want to stop. Why?
The play kids engage in typically mirrors their inner dialogue. Chloe
may see herself as an intrepid and divinely authorized warrior against
an army of opponents. While not unusual for her age, the symbolism may
be particularly resonant for her current position as a child feeling
weak against adults clearly fighting around and over her.

Once she assigned me to be an animal and asked me to reside with her
under the deck. Actually I found it cold under the deck so I moved into
the sun. I said (in character) that I preferred to live here. She became
passive aggressive, saying I could choose to live there but I would be
eaten by animals and she would not feel sad for me when that occurs,
because I declined her help. I expressed sadness and surprise that she
would not feel sad for me. I asked if she could simply move into the sun
also. After determining guilt and fear were not effective, she became
more empathetic and decided to instead build a "house" next to mine and
protect me.

In another role play, Chloe calls me “momma” and I know we are bobcats.
The momma bobcat declined to tell the baby what a daddy is, so the baby
is confused. This play corresponded with August when Chloe’s biological
father was calling her on the telephone and saying he finally wanted to
meet her. This was incredibly hard (and very confusing) for Chloe! She
manifested it in play where she could explore what it might mean.

Sometimes Chloe would sit in the closet with stuffed animals all facing
her. In this place she would discuss Emily’s cancer. When I saw this
configuration of toys, I knew the discussion to be very serious. I
visited very calmly and quietly. In these instances more than any other,
my goal was to hear how she feels, support those feelings with love and
understanding, and reassure her that she would be ok and would be taken
care of. That message was taught to me by grief counsellors as the most
important message for a child facing parental bereavement.

Around October Chloe started pretending she needed crutches because “I
tripped on Stanley,” a dog she tripped on. Around that time, Donna
transferred Chloe from Jefferson to Stanley Elementary School. I asked
if there was a dog named Grant, and one named Bryant, as those are
schools where Emily and I applied for her to enroll in the 2^nd^ grade,
before CPS placed Chloe in Donna’s temporary care. Chloe said those were
wiener dogs, and Howell (another school we considered a backup) was a
pony. She brings up this story routinely: She’ll find something that
looks like a crutch (such as the golf putter), and begin limping,
explaining, “I tripped on Stanley.” When played out at my mother’s
house, my mother’s bedroom becomes the “princess hospital” where
princesses recover from tripping on dogs.

Chloe and I began role-playing on November 8^th^, 2014. She invented a
“laughter institute” where people go to laugh. Then she invented an
“anger institute” where people go to get angry. We simulated growing
levels of anger toward each other and the world in general. At a point
during the role-play, she switched into a deeper level of authenticity,
and said, “It’s not even about me! It’s just about the money!” I don’t
know what this might be about, and it’s important not to draw
conclusions based on a single detail, but I think this might be part of
something she is perceiving as going on around her.

32. Why are you an advocate of “play therapy?”
==============================================

Self-expression through play can heal emotional wounds. In Chloe
Murphy's case I will take this a bit further: People of unusual
creativity and intellect have the same joy in their smiles and salt in
their tears, but also have the capacity to *define* these things, and
the emotional imperative to do so to remain healthy. Play, art, and
music therapy have helped Chloe tremendously.

33. Should all parents/people learn this technique and engage with children in this fashion? Why or why not?
============================================================================================================

There's nothing to be gained from a lack of perspective. So, it would
probably be helpful for most parents to learn about play therapy,
particularly with children who have lost a parent.

34. Who else do you know that engages with children in this manner?
===================================================================

See \#30.

35. Do you ever relate to Chloe in any other way? Why or why not? 
==================================================================

I know you noticed I described “play therapy,” and you’ve asked good
questions about why I used this term, but it is not even the main way I
relate to Chloe. Most of the time I’m just a man who has understood
myself to be Chloe’s father for many years. I have purchased a
substantial quantity of supervisor reports that demonstrate me relating
to Chloe as a parent, teacher, role model, family member, authority
figure, protector, and as a friend. I got her to therapy in both Seattle
and Tacoma, assured she did her homework before the evening relaxation
activities would commence, assured she played in the park with school
friends, taught her to ride a bike and rode around town with her, took
her to and from school, organized visits to the zoo, beach, and museums.

My relationship with Chloe focuses heavily on education. Emily spoke
many times about the pre-conditions for Chloe to seek and earn a
post-secondary education. My Dad related an early conversation several
years ago in which Emily asked, “Herb, why do some people go to college
and some never consider it?” He and Emily subsequently spent many hours
taking of such growth.

-   I subscribed to Ranger Rick for Chloe, a magazine she loves, where
    animals are discussed and studied in detail.

-   During a visit on October 24^th^, Chloe said, “I do multiplication.
    Do I learn it in 2^nd^ grade? No! I learn it from *this guy!”* She
    pointed at me.

-   In March Chloe prepared a certification that now hangs on my wall
    from the *John Dempsey school of Science, Multiplication, Division,
    and Times.*

-   I take Chloe to the zoo and beach and actively explore with her.

-   I taught Chloe to play chess when she was 5.

-   I took Chloe to the Seattle Science Center twice, and Seattle Center
    at least 10 times for dancing, singing, and other activities.

-   Since 2013 I have provided Chloe with a variety of logic games on my
    tablet computer.

-   

I have a Bachelor of Arts degree and career in computer software. The
software industry is heavily dominated by men. Women from Asian
countries are also represented, which strongly suggests the bias toward
males is cultural. This bias appears throughout science and engineering.
One of my first promises to Emily made years ago was that I would
prepare Chloe to meet her potential in the sciences. I resolved to teach
Chloe math from an early age because I know girls will fall behind in
math due to social pressure when they’re 10 years old. This cultural
bias substantially harms both personal and earning potential. Emily was
adamant that Chloe be exposed regularly to extracurricular
opportunities, especially in the sciences, and specifically, “All of
them.” Chloe deserves to continue participating with me in the
enthusiastic inquiry I place on math, exploration, and the sciences.

36. Name all of the various parenting classes that you have personally attended. Give the dates attended and the name of the classes.
=====================================================================================================================================

-   In 2014, HopeSparks 3^rd^ Party Custody Training (4 hours)

-   In 2014, Emily Murphy instructed by teaching me the following three
    steps to successful parenting: (1) Love (2) Patience (3) Love. She
    provided verbal certification of successful completion of
    her training. ;)

-   In 1999, I volunteered weekly for a year at Flying Colors
    Therapeutic Childcare, a service of Seattle Chidren’s Home.

-   From 2013, I attended monthly therapy at Bridges: Center for
    Grieving Children

-   In 2014, I attended Gilda’s Club twice each month with Chloe, and
    with Emily at first.

-   In 1990, I volunteered at Explorer Junior High School in the Bethel
    School District for academic credit.

-   Around 1993, I volunteered at NOVA alternative High School in the
    Seattle School District.

37. Who thought or currently thinks that they would benefit from having custody of Chloe financially? What is the current status of that issue?
===============================================================================================================================================

Whoever has custody of Chloe will receive a check from the U.S. Treasury
for \$892, probably monthly. The same party will work with professional
trust administrators to spend trust money on Chloe’s behalf, which is
likely to include monthly distributions. Those are the objective facts
about the financial implications of custody. But who thought the most
about it? Based on behavior, I believe Darin Murphy (Emily’s father) and
Kyle Coker (Chloe’s biological father) acted in this matter based on
financial motives.

After a meeting at Uncle Howard Dempsey’s in early November, 2012, we
returned to Darin's house. He pulled out a white board. He wrote
\$250,000 and wrote \$125,000 twice. He asked Emily to confirm her
Marines life insurance was split between Donna and Chloe. Emily
confirmed it was. Darin said, "We wouldn’t want your survivor benefit to
go to household debt." I agreed. I studied Donna’s finances years
earlier and had serious concerns. Darin suggested the potential for
Chloe to own the house she lived in. I had felt for some time that the
large house without Emily would not and should not house two aging
adults and massive amounts of junk. It was dangerous outside and
underutilized. Donna had financed half a remodel on credit cards.
Richard, a man with many tools, didn't appear to complete the remodel at
any pace. It seemed likely the unsustainable finances would be sustained
by money that belonged to Chloe. This still seems likely today.

The day Emily signed her final will, she said to me, “I want to give you
all the tools you might need to keep Dad from interfering with the plan
for Chloe.” Emily regularly said she saw no relationship between Darin
and Chloe, only “grumpy grandpa”, and worried that Darin would seek
custody of Chloe. On the same day, in the meeting with Joni Irvin, Darin
asserted that he would be the best choice for Chloe, as he did again in
a declaration to the court.

I came to believe money might be driving the fierce opposition to my
cause before the court. Once Eileen Peterson suggested professional
trust management, I agreed immediately, even though the will specified
me as trust manager. Todd Tuell, probate attorney for the Mairs,
received our suggestion of professional trust management by
counter-proposing Commencement Trust Management. We determined that it
is run by Robin, who we determined to be romantically involved with
attorney Michael Howard, whose relationship with Darin was called “a
clear conflict of interest” by Dr. Natalie Dong. After we ignored the
counter-proposal, Darin stopped attending hearings, and Kyle Coker
stopped responding to all email and telephone communications. Coker’s
silence should cast serious doubt on his statement that he loves Chloe
“with all his heart.” Further, his pleading that he was “swindled” out
of Chloe might be telling.

I earn a strong wage in the software industry. I came to Tacoma unaware
there are substantial financial resources accompanying Chloe. On or
around January 5^th^, 2014, I told Darin that Kyle Coker owed Emily
\$16,000, and adoption was the only way to prevent him from taking
custody of Chloe out of financial motives. (Please realize we all
struggled with the legal dimensions of this throughout this experience.)
Darin said he was not aware of this risk. He may have used it to
persuade Kyle to get involved after Emily’s passing, but I have no
specific information about what went on between them, except that they
were in communication and Darin planned to host Kyle in August for the
purpose of Kyle spending time with Chloe. I don’t think this visit
occurred.

38. How much money will Chloe inherit? Who is responsible for safe guarding that money? Please give me the name of that individual, the address, and phone number. Is there a court order that outlines this individual’s duties? If so, when was it filed and where is that filed? Could you provide me a copy of this order, if any?
======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Chloe will inherit about \$405,000, and a monthly payment of \$892 from
the US Treasury (Social Security). Chris Neil, a professional trust
manager, will safeguard these funds. The court order has been prepared
but not signed yet.

39. When is the last time that you saw Chloe unsupervised? 
===========================================================

May 19^th^, 2014, 8:00am, when I stopped car at her school, hugged her,
told her I love her, and told her to have a good day learning as an
enthusiastic student.

40. Explain, in your own words, the recent supervised visit that you attended with Chloe when the supervisor became very frustrated with you and addressed it in the supervised visitation notes. 
==================================================================================================================================================================================================

I assume that you are referring to the visitation that took place on
October 5^th^, at the home of my uncle, Howard Dempsey. A person named
Sarah was the supervisor. The visit took place over four hours. My uncle
was present during much of the visitation, and witnessed some of the
alleged interactions between myself and Sarah. He has a very different
account than Sarah’s.

The most serious accusation in the visitation report authored by Sarah
is based on events which I remember quite differently. When I asked
Sarah "How many 'I Love yous' and 'how many daddy's?'" she had heard,
Sarah clearly responded with an affirmative - indicating that she had
heard them. In fact she said, “Oh, it’s clear!” I said my status as
Chloe's dad is disputed, and Sarah smiled and agreed with me. Sarah
never told me to stop doing anything. So I proceeded to explain why I
felt Chloe's feelings deserve a more central role in the reporting:
Because I am the subject of a smear campaign, because it's been alleged
that I have no legitimate relationship with Chloe or Emily. I was not
out of control. I have simply been frustrated by the allegations that
have been made against me, and the ongoing litigation to destroy my
relationship with Chloe. I was trying to understand why statements about
Chloe's emotional context are consistently lacking in Sarah's reports.

At some point Sarah told me that she would not discuss details of the
case with me, so I moved to safer ground. I asked questions about where
she was from, what music she enjoyed, and the like. These were types of
comments/questions I had had with other supervisors. I was merely trying
to make conversation. I believe most people would receive this subject
shift as a clear intent to respect boundaries, but Sarah did not. I
laughed to myself because despite my best efforts, I felt alone in the
room. Howard Dempsey, retired schoolteacher, overheard the conclusion of
the alleged verbal assault and considered my efforts at calm
communication to be appropriate, while Sarah's responses were unusual.

My attorney, Alece Cox, sent a letter to Community Family Services in
response to that visitation report. Please incorporate that letter as
part of my answer to this question.

41. Do you believe that healthy boundaries with Chloe include you sleeping with Chloe? Why or why not? Have you slept with Chloe? If so, when, where, and why? 
===============================================================================================================================================================

Age 2-4, and once when 5: Typically when visiting, Chloe slept in a
smaller bed nearby, a small flip-down mattress, but sometimes I needed
that mattress at work. (I frequently work laying down due to back and
neck pain.) On Capitol Hill in Seattle I lived in a small studio
apartment. When necessary, Chloe slept in my bed, a full-size bed,
clothed in night clothes just as I was. This is common family behavior
and healthy re-assurance to a young child, especially when sleeping
somewhere other than their primary bed. When Emily was present, there
was no additional room for Chloe in the main bed, so she slept in the
little bed, despite protests. At my present residence, Chloe has her own
room and bed.

42. Do you believe that healthy boundaries, with Chloe, include her being allowed to run around naked, as alleged when her mother’s care givers were present? Why or why not?
=============================================================================================================================================================================

I do not allow Chloe to run around naked! I ask her to dress when I see
her naked. I prohibit Chloe from running around naked every time I have
seen it, and demand she put on clothes. But she liked to occasionally be
*in her room* both partially and fully unclothed. There may have been
times when everybody was tied up tending to Emily when the caregivers
saw a naked child streaking across the 15th floor apartment room but it
was not the rule. Please keep in mind that toward the end of her life
Emily needed 24-hour care, most of which was provided by me. I don't
mean to suggest that I was unable to care for Chloe at the same time I
was caring for Emily, however, toward the end I was very fatigued with
overnight duties and very focused on care-giving requirements.

43. Do you believe that healthy boundaries with Chloe include you bathing with Chloe? Why or why not? Have you bathed with Chloe? If so, when, where and why?
=============================================================================================================================================================

When she was 2 and 3, Chloe and routinely took baths with Emily and me.
It was fun. Splash, make silly hats out of suds. I had a big white
bucket that we would fill up and pour on each other’s heads. Chloe liked
to hold her breath. We both liked splashing each other as much as we
could. When she was 2, she asked Emily and me about the difference
between daddy and mommy, and we explained the difference as best we
could. It all seemed natural and straightforward, and not erotic
whatsoever. Around age 3 I began using a heavy bubble bath that made the
water milky white, and at age 4 Chloe took her final bubble bath with
me. The locations were at Emily’s apartment, at my house in University
District, and once at my house in Capitol Hill. Nothing seemed strange
about this behavior. Emily was aware of all of it. It was something
Chloe clearly enjoyed for the right reasons. Then at some point Chloe
seemed to become more interested in physiology than in suds and
splashing, and I decided it was time to end this fun part of her
childhood.

44. Do you believe that healthy boundaries with Chloe include you allowing Chloe to lie on top of you? Why or why not? Have you allowed her to lie on top of you? If so, when, where and why? 
==============================================================================================================================================================================================

Since age 2, Chloe and I engaged in active play, including dance. Emily,
Chloe and I enjoyed visiting Festival of Dance Improvisation (SFDI) in
Capitol Hill, Seattle each Sunday, where we and other families developed
movement awareness and trust in a bright studio with a mirror wall. I
have been a member of this dance group for eleven years. Chloe is
experienced and accustomed to gymnastic activities with me. When Chloe
was younger she would lay on my chest, but she’s too big for that now.
When we do dance and play gymnastically, there is occasional contact. I
think it’s healthy behavior that has nothing to do with erotic
experience or expression.

45. Do you believe that healthy boundaries with Chloe include you allowing Chloe to sit on your lap, in light of the CPS allegations? Why or why not?
=====================================================================================================================================================

The CPS allegations are far-reaching, consistently false or misleading,
and are not the allegations of CPS. They are allegations *relayed to*
CPS, which CPS has not substantiated. I deny that I have acted
inappropriately toward Chloe in any manner. Chloe and I have a
father-daughter relationship. Kids sit on their parents’ laps to discuss
important things, feel secure, tell family secrets and a host of other
reasons. Chloe views me as her Dad and I believe she is my Daughter. We
practiced that for a great many years. It is evident in the various
written supervision reports that Chloe wants reassurance from me.
Contact is a central component of healthy parent-child relationships. I
strongly doubt the perceptions of Andrea Mattsen, and CPS did not
substantiate any of Ms. Mattsen’s allegations.

46. Do you believe that healthy boundaries with Chloe include her visiting with you alone? Why or why not?
==========================================================================================================

I do, with certainty! I have known Chloe since she was not quite two
years old, and am the only father she has ever known.

I have now produced 100+ pages of supervised visitation reports, each
articulating the sorts of experiences and interactions that happen when
Chloe and I are together. I have several years with Chloe alone visiting
me in a number of different situations all of which have been
problem-free. Many of those were family events in Emily's company, but
sometimes Emily just sent me off with Chloe, and we had enormously
healthy, memorable experiences together. I have a large family of
professionals and each can add much on both boundaries and what both
Chloe and I gained from many extended experiences. Healthy boundaries
would also include phone contact with Chloe (she loves to talk on the
phone), communicating with her via email/text, and visitation at Chloe's
school and in her social activities. I have always been there for Chloe.
She needs to return to a sense of normalcy. Chloe visiting me only with
supervision limits and diminishes the clear value of our healthy
father-daughter relationship.

47. Describe the interpersonal physical and emotional abuse displayed by Chloe’s biological family.
===================================================================================================

Abandonment by Kyle Coker
-------------------------

With the exception of Kyle Coker's total absence from Chloe's life, I
know very little about the paternal side of Chloe's family and for that
reason cannot comment on it. Kyle Coker has other daughters. Prior to
July, 2014, I’m not aware of anyone in Kyle Coker's family showing any
interest in Chloe, which I believe amounts to emotional abuse. During
July, 2014, Kyle Coker called Chloe on the telephone and said he wanted
to meet her. He did not follow through. This is more neglect and abuse
at a critical time for her.

Abuse of Darin by his mother
----------------------------

Darin was abused by Andrea Mattsen through whipping until he was 8.

Abuse of Mariela (Darin’s 3^rd^ wife)
-------------------------------------

According to accounts that appear in the adoption records for Juan,
Juan’s biological father physically abused Mariela in Mexico, Emily told
me.

Abuse of Darin by Dina (2^nd^ wife)
-----------------------------------

Dina was a narcissist controller. Darin recounted isolation perpetrated
by Dina. She separated him from his children, and destroyed photographs
that included Donna. She prevented Darin from attending the wedding of
Sarah and Greg. Dina stole or tried to steal in excess of \$100,000 from
Darin during their marriage by taking his checks into her account to pay
the mortgage, and then not paying it. Other details might appear in
their divorce documents.

Abuse of Emily by parents
-------------------------

Emily began experiencing severe emotional abuse when Emily told her
parents I would raise Chloe in very early December. Emily’s father and
mother began on the same day telling her she was not competent to make
decisions. (During the second adoption meeting, Darin vocally and
forcefully denied telling Emily she was not competent decisions, and
argued that the conversation could not have occurred because he was in
Mexcio. In fact it occurred before he left for Mexcico.) Though he
pledged full support in late November, Darin began insisting that I was
not a good pick for Chloe, and that Emily was not competent to make her
own decisions. Donna repeated this later in the same day. Emily
explained in a Skype call to me how this was exceptionally upsetting and
painful because she did have brain cancer, and so felt deeply troubled
by these assertions, which she characterized as abuse, while crying.

When this assertion came from Donna a second time, I told my Uncle
Howard and Emily was being abused. That night I found a duplex near her
home where we could move. The duplex would only be available after a few
days of delay, so I took Emily and Chloe to my sister Jan Dempsey’s’
home for the weekend.

Around late February, Darin told Emily she was “being abused” during a
car ride. Upon returning home she moved far into the kitchen, where I
hugged her. She began crying and said, “I like how we talk about our
feelings here.”

Emily yelled on two occasions, “I’M THE ONE WITH CANCER!” Try to
understand the amount of interference coming from her father and mother,
under the pretext of “concern” and “love”. Emily noted the difference in
tone and support between my biological family and hers many times.

Abuse of Chloe by Donna
-----------------------

### Guilt

Based on what Chloe said, I believe Donna is now saying something to the
effect of: "You don't want to hurt John by calling him Dad at this
difficult time." Telling her I’m not hurt by being called Dad, and in
fact I think it’s great, gives her an incredible smile. Donna and Darin
both focus a great deal on the alleged feelings of others, saying we
wouldn’t want to hurt others. This easily extends to imagined, fake
feelings of others, as in this case, and is a sinister means to
manipulate a child.

### “Gotcha”

In May, 2014, I witnessed Donna zero in on an alleged lie by Chloe
Murphy. Donna noticed a minor detail discrepancy that Chloe could not
have known: I said I would call Chloe’s teacher but met with her
instead. Donna interrogated Chloe about this discrepancy, even though
Chloe had no way to know I had changed the contact approach. This seemed
strange considering the detail does not matter at all. Chloe was visibly
frightened by this interrogation and allegation that she was lying.
After observing many examples, I believe “GOTCHA” is Donna’s technique
for controlling others, including children. I believe Chloe faced
punishment for an error, rather than a deception, which she had no
awareness of. Donna also used “gotcha” toward me to derail the adoption,
fixating on tiny details that contradict the norm, rather than choosing
details that represent the norm. I think it’s a very harmful tactic with
children.

### Physical

Donna specified a willingness to spank Chloe in her declaration to the
court. I am disturbed by this because Chloe will experience the 5 stages
of grief through every level of her development that will manifest as
both anger and depression. It’s critical to her mental health that anger
from grief NOT be met with hostility! This is a well-known risk in grief
counselling! In Donna’s care these patterns won't be identified as
anything more than misbehavior and Chloe will be punished for it,
probably with spankings, according to their pleading to the court.

I am much more reluctant to use spanking because it easily communicates
that might makes right and fear and pain are available for the
non-complaint. My “swats” are now very rare and always sought to bruise
the ego, not the body. I have swatted Chloe once in 2014.

On September 18^th^, Chloe Murphy said Donna Mairs had hit her hard in
the head.

### Out-of-control Behavior

Around May 16^th^, Donna showed hostility toward me in front of Chloe
which Chloe found extremely distressing. Chloe cowered behind me while
Donna raged around the house and in the yard, slamming the car door and
screeching.

### Abusive use of Conflict

See Answer \#49.

### Inappropriate Details and Guidance

On October 31^st^, 2014, Chloe explained that when Donna and Richard
die, Chloe will live with Pat. Pat is Darin’s brother. He wrote to Emily
about adopting Chloe, in a letter that included the distinctly
non-Murphy sentence: “Whatever you choose, I support you.” Emily had
considered Pat and his wife as a future for Chloe when she was much
younger. I know Chloe considers life fragile, and regularly asks who
would take care of her after her current care-givers die. On advice of
many therapists and friends, I had a healthy, helpful answer to this
question: “I’m really strong and healthy. I will probably live a long
time. So you don’t have to worry about losing me.” Donna is not
demonstrating any understanding of the importance of this message,
because Donna has no training in care for a child with Chloe’s needs.
Planning for Chloe is an obligation, but revealing information about
theoreticals like these is harmful to Chloe psychologically. Emily
wanted me to care for Chloe because I am young, active, and live a
healthy lifestyle. Donna and Richard may be in a position where they
need to plan for their own death or incapacitation if Chloe is placed in
their custody permanently. That’s still no excuse for answering her
questions in this manner!

Abuse of Chloe by Darin
-----------------------

See \#24.

Abuse of Chloe by unknown parties 
----------------------------------

Presentation of confusing information about adoption by Uncle Ned, March
2014.

During a recent visit, Chloe Murphy could not identify the source of a
bruise on her arm.

Abuse of Chloe by Ally
----------------------

Chloe was sexually assaulted by Ally twice.

Abuse of Ally
-------------

Documented in other answers.

Abuse of Jenny by Brian
-----------------------

Documented in other answers.

Abuse by child caregiver
------------------------

The family had hired a caregiver in the 80’s or very early 90’s who the
children said lacked empathy, and may have been physically abusive,
Darin relayed to me at the time. She was released.

Consequences of Abuse
---------------------

The severe abuse is psychological. Donna and Darin use guilt and shame
on children and susceptible adults. Guilt and shame are powerful, very
destructive tools. I believe Donna learned these behaviors as a victim
of spousal abuse. Shame is brutally effective but extremely harmful to
self-esteem of a child, and causes loss of independent initiative.
Excepting Sergeant Emily Murphy, none of Donna's 3 other children have
attained any post-secondary degree in any subject. One does not work
outside the home, and the two others work for low wages in retail
environments.

Donna often seems derailed by guilt and blame feelings toward herself
and others. After spending time with Donna, Chloe repeats complex,
troubling explanations of guilt and shame she claims to feel, and
asserts that I should also feel. She often cries while explaining why
she and others are victims and perpetrators of shame patterns. While
residing we me, Chloe would return from Donna's care, present these
explanations, and cry briefly when I explained I didn’t believe anyone
should feel guilty. Then she’d be fine.

Starting in summer 2013 when I began attending Bridges grief therapy
with Emily, I noticed her parents spoke of her like she was already
gone. Allison witnessed this in the last days of her life.  It went on a
long time. I said in therapy many, many times: "but you are alive now! I
want to be happy with you now!" When Emily moved in with me, Donna
attacked me at Bridges therapy, insisting on information about Emily's
state and well-being. I looked at Emily and said, "she is right here! 
You can speak to her directly! Go ahead and address your questions
directly to Emily!" I characterize Donna’s attitude that day as one of
jealousy toward me and feeling ashamed about the change that had
occurred.

From adoption to medical and legal professionals, members of my family
with advanced degrees in education and business carried on detailed,
specific conversations with Emily, regarding her life and plans, very
consistent over time, well into her hospice care. The ONLY factor was
her ability to find words.  No one but her parents seemed to think she
lacked clarity, not even her friends Bettina, Janette and Allison. I
believe it was just a delusion propagated by Darin through Donna for
purpose of regaining control of the money and the child. It was also
severely abusive to Emily and she deeply resented it. She said she did!
Only when we learned to laugh at the outrageous claims did we regain
some control.

This document relays other instances of emotional abuse in answers to
other questions.

Emily on the destruction of her family
--------------------------------------

During both Bridges therapy and Gilda’s Club therapy, the therapists
explained to Emily and me that events like losing a family member tend
to cause families to operate according to the dynamics and principles
*on which the families were founded.* I reflected on this a lot as I
watched the behaviors get more and more erratic and strange. Regardless
of where this family might stand today, it was clearly built on very
destructive dynamics. This may be why Emily said witnessing the
destruction of this once-close family was painful for her but its
implosion was not necessarily a bad thing.

Abuse of me
-----------

On one occasion, in February, Darin and Donna appeared at Bridges. Darin
appeared to try to persuade Donna to accept Emily’s new residence and
choice. This seemed hopeful. But about a month later, Darin appeared
with both wives, Donna and Mariela, and used Bridges to attack me for
“betraying” the family. I knew my loyalty was to Emily. I consider the
basic logic at work that day to be a clear example of how the family
blurs boundaries around autonomy, because they were insisting I had an
obligation to them that overarched my loyalty to Emily, namely to
support Emily except where Darin or Donna disagreed with Emily’s
choices. Disagreement is disloyalty, plain and simple. After the session
I asked Mariela how I betrayed anyone. She said Chloe should be with her
or Donna. I said, “It’s ok to have that opinion,” but then I asked if
Emily had betrayed anyone. Mariela said, “No.” She argued that Emily had
given Chloe to me without wisdom or intention. A lengthy record
contradicts this view. Darin listened to this conversation, but had
nothing to say.

In a telephone conversation about where Chloe would sleep for the
evening, a phone call with Donna was disconnected. Emily said Donna hung
up intentionally. I called back and specified I would be over in 15
minutes to get Chloe and return her to her home. I did so without
incident. Later, in a telephone conversation about Emily’s cellular
phone, Darin hung up on me rather than discuss the matter.

Intervener documents and motions show a clear pattern of abusive,
misleading, and disingenuous statements and behaviors intended to harm
my reputation and compel me to abandon the cause before the court.

48. What is the name of the social worker that asked you to make arrangements for Chloe to be with Donna?
=========================================================================================================

Mernetha Rogers

49. Explain, in your own words, how Donna is asking Chloe to choose sides. Please give me specific **dates and times**. 
========================================================================================================================

Chloe said around May 16^th^, with enormous anxiety, “I hate being in
the middle.” This experience was documented in the previous intake
paperwork.

Ongoing persuasion effort around term ‘Dad”
-------------------------------------------

When speaking with Chloe around me, Donna referred to me as dad until
2014. Even into 2014 she maintained this. Around the time the police
retrieved Chloe from Donna, Donna stopped calling me Chloe’s dad.

Around March, 2014 on three occasions when Chloe returned from Donna’s,
Chloe tried to explain to me why I’m not family, why I’ll never be
actual, authentic family. Each time Emily and I discussed the thesis
with her, and she would always agree that family is a looser construct
than Donna’s understanding of it, once concluding, “We can choose our
family!” Emily and I would happily declare that we’re a family and enjoy
a family hug.

On June 20^th^, 2014, Chloe asked if she could still call me Dad. I said
yes, and she appeared to be happy about that.

During a visit at the Pierce County Fair, after a longer period of time
separated from Chloe due to the Ex Parte order of Commissioner
Kikendahl, I noticed Chloe was calling me John. I asked her if she wants
me to be her dad, and she said enthusiastically that she did. I told her
I will be dad if she wants me to, and she appeared to be very happy,
again proceeding to use the term when addressing me for the remainder of
the visit.

During a visit on or near October 25^th^ I noticed she was calling me
John again, and I asked her why. She said she “didn’t want it to be
weird.” I told her it’s not weird to me, and that I like it. Her face
lit up. She instructed me to call her “sweety”. At the next bowling
alley visit, she extended this request to include “sweetheart” and
“ladybug”. I believe the message given to her was that calling me Dad
made ME uncomfortable.  This is consistent with the “we must be
thoughtful” manipulation Donna practices. Addressing it directly by
saying I like when she called me Dad put her greatly at ease and
appeared to make her face light up. How much damage will be done to her
before she is wise enough to see though this sort of manipulation?

Alienation effort against me
----------------------------

During a visit in Downtown Tacoma, on October 9^th^, Chloe said Donna
had claimed I had voluntarily delivered Chloe to Donna because I was
unable to care for her for “that week”. I said that was untrue. Chloe
became upset and responded, “Grandma is tring to make me not like you!
Why? Why is she doing that?” I told Chloe I did not know, and that she
needed to ask Donna why. Charlotte observed and participated in the
conversation.

On June 20^th^, Chloe said, "Grandma says you weren't mom's partner."

On June 20^th^, Chloe asked, "Why were you mean to Darin?" Chloe did not
see me with Darin Murphy, so she is recounting something second-hand,
probably the conflict about control of Emily’s personal property. Her
perception is that I was mean to Darin Murphy. Why should a child be
given the perception that anyone was mean to anyone? This is certainly
not her own appraisal, because she could not have witnessed any
conversation between Darin and me.

On June 20^th^, Chloe asked, "Why won't you give back mom's phone?"
Chloe explained that someone on Emily's phone had a horse (which I had
never heard before, and am not aware of any horse ride previously), and
that due to my possession of the phone, she was unable to "ride a horse
rather than thinking about mom's death." I am executor of Emily's
estate, with legal obligations that should be clear to the adults
involved. Previously Darin Murphy had exerted substantial pressure to
gain control of this telephone. I have never received any request for
this contact’s information. An adult introduced this explanation to
Chloe, abusing her in the conflict while also alienating me from her.

During the visit to the Puyallup Fair in 2014, Chloe told me, “Grandma
says you aren’t really family.” When I asked Chloe what she thinks, she
said she was not sure if I am family, but went on to say she wished to
reside with me.

Deprivation from critical therapy
---------------------------------

On June 20^th^, Chloe said, "I can't go to Gilda's Club. Not even Camp
Sparkle!" Only after the effort of my father did Chloe attend Camp
Sparkle, which she speaks of regularly and fondly. Why has CPS and Donna
Mairs separated Chloe from the well-laid plans for this period
established by her mother and me, including Grant Elementary for the
Expressive Arts, Gilda's Club, Camp Sparkle, and Bridges grief therapy?
Chloe is unusually artistic and expressive! But her therapy regime has
been replaced with a non-art therapist.

Alienation effort against my family
-----------------------------------

On June 20^th^, Chloe said, “"Grandma says I can't see you and I can't
see anyone in your family, not even Epona!" Donna Mairs also prohibited
Howard Dempsey from attending the visit on that day at his home. On
October 1^st^, Chloe explained that Donna prohibits all adult members of
my family from attending visits, unless the visit occurs on their own
property. Chloe stated that she wished they could attend. I agreed to
keep asking Donna to approve any adult member of my family. On about 4
occasions since, I invited Donna to choose an adult member of my family
to attend a visit, or invite Chloe to choose. Donna first chose Epona, a
13 year old. When I explained that Epona was not an adult, Donna
prohibited any other members from attending. Once I failed to explicitly
prohibit Epona from being chosen, so Donna chose her again. On November
8^th^ Chloe explained that Donna’s strictness is rooted in not wanting
Chloe exposed to any “bad influences.” I continue requesting the GAL to
overrule this hostile effort to destroy relationships Chloe developed
with Emily’s full support over 5 years, which I can substantiate with
strong photographic evidence. I also strongly object to the
characterization of my family as full of “bad influences,” **especially
in conversations with Chloe Murphy**.

My biological family regularly took her to the park, zoo, and mountain,
or just played with Chloe while I cared for Emily. I have no reason to
believe they are a bad influence on anyone, and Chloe misses them.

Efforts at resolution
---------------------

In May my father strongly suggested to Darin Murphy that a parenting
plan should be established, saying templates are available. A parenting
plan would include clear language about the inappropriateness of these
remarks and behaviors. To date, no discussion of a voluntary parenting
plan has occurred.

Denial of hope for hearing by court
-----------------------------------

Chloe has articulated to me a long-standing wish and intention to reside
with me. At one point very early on I promised she would get to speak to
the court “of wise people” about her wishes. She reminded me of this
promise on four occasions during visits, asking when she would get to
speak to the court. I have intentionally specified her as a witness at
her own trial. During the Puyallup Fair visit, Chloe said that Donna
said Chloe would not get to speak to the court. This clearly dispirited
Chloe. I responded, “Grandma isn’t the boss of everything!”

Donna consistently makes poor judgments about what information should be
relayed to Chloe about the situation, and acts as if “anything goes”
with regard to communications with the child experiencing a custody
dispute. I wish Donna would avoid speculative and authoritative
statements and instead behave like a party in a case before a court that
has not been resolved.

50. Are you the executor of Ms. Murphy’s estate?
================================================

Yes.

51. Did Ms. Murphy want to marry you prior to her death? Explain in detail why that did not happen.
===================================================================================================

Emily did want to marry me.

On a drive in December to our visit our friends Carolee and Jerome
Johnson, Emily asked if I would be there to the end, and I said I would.
In February, I made the following vow to her: “I love you and Chloe. I
am loyal to you and to Chloe. I will never surrender.” I whispered this
vow to her every time I saw her at Darin’s house, and continue repeating
it many times each day.

We discussed the details of a potential legal marriage in November. I
examined the question carefully with my sister Jan Dempsey and my
long-time friend Walter Wittel. Both expressed serious concerns that we
could not know how Emily would die. We realized she could easily
experience a long, slow death at dramatic expense in an intensive care
environment. We further realized this could bankrupt us both, in our
marital estate. How could I raise Chloe if that happened? So we agreed
on a compromise: I promised a commitment ceremony primarily for Chloe’s
benefit, where both families would show Chloe the breadth of support she
has. This ceremony would include “everything but the legal papers.”
However, Darin Murphy accused me of substantial crimes including the
intent to sexually abuse Chloe. In the same meeting, he expressed
disgust that I did not intend to marry Emily. (Pause and think about the
combination he presents: I’m a molester who didn’t marry his daughter.
Would he be happy if I married his daughter? Would you be happy if a
molester married your daughter?) It didn’t seem possible for Chloe to
experience a healthy ceremony between the families with dramatic,
substantial, excoriating, irrational hostility coming consistently from
Darin Murphy.

Emily mentioned wanting a ring once more, after Darin Murphy and two of
his wives subverted the adoption meeting at Joni Irvin’s office (the
first meeting occurred there). Emily insisted on going to the bar and
getting drunk. Starting her drink, she said she wanted a ring. I asked
her what a ring would add to the promise I had made. I persuaded her to
leave the drink un-finished and come home.

Understand I made these choices and plans without knowing Chloe has life
insurance funds, without understanding the scope of coverage available
to Emily from military medical insurance, and without knowing how Emily
would die. I strongly considered the fact that she insisted on all
methods of artificial life support. I confirmed this wish with her many
times. I studied and practiced C.P.R. and made a plan for isolating
Chloe safe with neighbors in case Emily had a medical emergency.

about Marriage more often than Emily did. He asked the day before
Thanksgiving, in San Francisco. He asked again on or around January
5^th^. (Emily responded that we would not be marrying, and later
expressed to me that his question annoyed her, and she hoped she had put
the question to bed.) Finally, during the second adoption meeting, Darin
asked a third time about marriage. Joyce Robson asked about a ceremony
and I explained that we had intended to have one that it now seemed
implausible that a father would smile as his daughter married a molester
of his granddaughter. In hindsight it’s clear to me his anger was
spiraling out of control and he was doing what he always does to regain
control: get in a meeting and bash everyone with innuendo and smears. A
ceremony seemed impossible after that day.

52. Since Donna choose a different format to address Chloe’s grief due to the loss of her mother, by employing Dr. Johnson, do you believe that Chloe is misunderstood and her needs are not being met? Explain why or why not.
===============================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Dr. Johnson’s involvement in this custody case is amateurish. I believe
Chloe needs and deserves more comprehensive and focused grief therapy.

Recently I taught Chloe “Big Yellow Taxi”, a beautiful song about loss.
Not all kids resonate with song as a way to understand complicated
emotions. Chloe is incredibly suited to a music and art therapy regime
for growth through grief.

-   Emily applied to enroll her in Grant Elementary for Expressive Arts.

-   I brought Chloe to Gilda’s Club for art therapy ever 2 weeks. The
    director of Gilda’s Club said she was benefiting from the therapy.

-   I made sure Chloe never missed Bridges, a program for grieving
    children ***and care-givers***.

Since Emily asked me in March, 2013 to attend the monthly BRIDGES: A
Center for Grieving Children program, I have attended nearly all monthly
programs with Chloe, and with Emily when possible. On a few occasions
even before I resided in Tacoma, I was the sole party to get them to
this program. Donna Mairs stopped attending BRIDGES regularly in
December, 2013. I have never seen Richard Mairs attend the BRIDGES
program. How closely are they attending to Chloe’s needs now and in the
future if they do not attend this critical program for her emotional
wellness during this transition?

A fully operational grief therapy program must include therapy and
training *for the care-givers* as well as the child. It is necessary to
know and recognize and respond to the 5 stages of grief—denial, anger,
bargaining, depression, and acceptance—because they will recur
throughout Chloe’s life at each successive level of emotional
development! During my training to meet Chloe’s needs, I’ve learned that
**it is critical the anger caused by grief not be met with hostility or
punishment.** Dr. Johnson’s help cannot suffice when it’s only attended
by the child. Donna and Richard Mairs began failing to meet Chloe’s
emotional needs when they walked away from Bridges grief training and
therapy in December, 2013.

53. Do you know if Donna plans on placing Chloe with Sarah, her daughter, if she obtains custody of Chloe? Explain in detail why that is a good or bad idea.
============================================================================================================================================================

I was not aware of Donna Mairs (Emily’s mother) advocating this idea
until you mentioned it. Darin Murphy (Emily’s father) advocated for
Sarah Urquhart (Emily’s sister) to adopt Chloe during the second
adoption meeting and in a declaration to the court. However, Emily had
serious problems with this idea.

Sarah advocates for medical marijuana on her Facebook page. Sarah asked
me to provide marijuana to Emily to treat her brain cancer. While I am
open-minded about the medical potential of marijuana in many cases,
including pain management, Emily did not think marijuana treatment was
based in fact-based science, and said to Joni Irvin, Joyce Robson, and
me that Sarah's view made Emily uncomfortable about Sarah's parenting
judgment.

Sarah’s Facebook page includes “420” in the URL, a reference to
marijuana culture:

<https://www.facebook.com/smurquhart420>

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/420_%28cannabis_culture%29>

30% of her posts and group memberships relate to marijuana as medicine.
I heard Sarah describe marijuana as medicine to Kris, her son. Sarah is
very actively engaged with Facebook and Facebook games. The most common
topic of her re-posts is marijuana.

Sarah’s husband is routinely away in studies. Emily cited this as a
serious problem with the three children they have, and was distressed
that Sarah talked about having another child, and saved clothes for
another child. With Chloe, that would be five children.

Sarah let a child sex offender into her home, and that person harmed
Ally. It’s my understanding Sarah was not aware of the offender’s past,
and rejected him from the home after the crime or crimes occurred.

When Sarah lived in Tacoma with two children, Emily would visit Sarah’s
apartment to help clean it. She said it was filthy, showing absence of
even basic habits for maintaining a sanitary home.

Placement of Chloe with Sarah’s family in Pullman would prevent Chloe
regular exposure to both most of my family and most of her biological
family, who reside around Puget Sound. It would also prevent regular
exposure to places like Seattle Science Center, and other
extracurricular science and technology exposures Emily and I highly
value.

Sarah and Greg Urquhart (Sarah’s husband) are extremely overweight.
Sarah’s new diabetic condition has caused some reduction in her weight.
Emily explained Greg was released from the Army due to his size. I
correctly Ally verbally once when in Tacoma, when she tried telling
Chloe that a jelly doughnut was a good breakfast. Greg told her it was,
so she believed it was. I told them both, “That kind of ‘breakfast’ will
make you crazy, and make you sick!” Emily always thanked me when I
insisted Chloe make healthy food choices based on evidence-based
information.

One reason why I think placing Chloe with Sarah is a bad idea is because
it is apparent that Donna (and possibly Sarah) planned this outcome
without being forthright about intentions. No one should circumvent the
investigation of the G.A.L., whose job it is to determine and fully
examine the best options for Chloe.

54. Has Donna been physically abused in the past? If so, by whom?
=================================================================

I have no specific information about physical abuse experienced by Donna
Mairs. Emily called Donna a “punching bag” twice in conversations with
my father. Most recently, when Donna arrived at the apartment, Emily
said to my father, “the punching bag is here.” Perhaps Emily’s meaning
was metaphorical, as I believe Donna was emotionally “pushed around” by
Darin.

I have examples of statements that indicate that Donna often feels
depressed, inadequate, self-critical, and guilty. I’ve seen her mentally
beat herself up, act as if she must always be busy, show fear of
confrontation and conflict, and suffer from feelings of perfectionism.
She shows polarized (“black-and-white”) thinking, refuses to consider
facts that aren’t congruent with existing beliefs, lacks creativity,
spontaneity, fun, and play, and feels shameful about her sexual past.

When Emily was hospitalized around January 25^th^, Donna said to me,
“People say your love is better than mine.” Love in my view is always
right, and always compatible. People who loved Emily should have been
able to cooperate for her. I find it easier to believe that Donna has
experienced a fake form of love.

55. Tell me all that you know about Andrea Mattson. Explain all of the contact that you have had with her. How old is she? Does she suffer from any type of mental illness? How do I contact her?
=================================================================================================================================================================================================

This question is over broad, but I will do the best I can. Andrea
Laycock Mattson lived in Kansas for 12 years on her horse ranch alone
until she developed a blood cancer a few years ago. For many years she
published information about the lineage of quarter horses, and published
one or two books on the subject. Darin (Emily's father) helped her with
a web site on the topic, <http://www.horsesonly.com>. When she developed
cancer, Darin relocated Andrea to his home in Tacoma.

My contact with Andrea Matts was limited to about 10 minutes of
conversation in Tacoma the night we left for Mexico, minor conversation
during travel, about 10 more minutes of conversation in Mexico, and
about 20 minutes of conversation in Tacoma in late 2013. I don’t know
her age. I would always ask about her health when I saw Darin. He said
consistently that her physical health had improved, but her mental
health had deteriorated.

I believe from the web site that her cellular phone number could be
785-617-0708, and her email may be <hoofnote@gmail.com>, though other
parties may monitor that email address with and for her.

56. Was Darin Murphy removed from her care as a child? Why and when? Who raised him? Give me as many details as possible.
=========================================================================================================================

I only know what Emily told me: At age 8, after suffering whippings that
left permanent scars Emily had seen, Darin was removed from Andrea’s
custody. I believe he was raised by Terrance Murphy, his biological
father. My mother, also from Kansas, notes the extreme rarity of
removing a child from the mother’s care in that era and state.

57. Please give me examples of borderline verbal abuse that Richard, Donna’s current spouse, perpetrates against Donna.
=======================================================================================================================

You are asking me to give examples of something Emily said. Emily
described the tone and conversations between Donna and Richard as
“bleak” and “cynical”. When she said that, I asked her what she meant.
She relayed the following incident: She needed something from the
basement. As a disabled person, she could not navigate the steps to the
basement, or maneuver in the junk-lined narrow corridors. She asked
Richard if he could get it. He said, “RIGHT NOW?” In her view, he
sounded like a teenager, not an adult. He sounded inconvenienced by
having to get up from his video game and walk downstairs.

During Jenny’s wedding Richard yelled at Kris to hold the rings and not
lose them. I found his tone to be frightening and mean, especially
because Kris is autistic. I put my arm around Kris and asked how he was
feeling, and walked him through the job of carrying the rings in a
wedding. I believe taking that tone with Kris is abusive.

58. Explain why Ms. Murphy did not want Chloe to be raised as a Mormon. 
========================================================================

Emily called the chuch “all fake,” said “God’s a bad idea,” and seemed
to completely reject theology as practiced by her mother as an illusion
or sad joke.

Emily knew the structure of the Mormon church to be patriarchal. She
also felt that the church was very focused on compliance. She knew that
“coloring outside the lines,” was not acceptable within the church and
its notions of family, and she knew Chloe to have a strong, independent,
creative will.

Emily explained how she dealt with family strictness when she was a
young adult in a Mormon household. She said the challenge was to appear
to be chaste, pious and obedient, while sneaking away to experience
sexual and drug-related activity. As a young woman, Emily would make out
with boys in Wapato Park, and take LSD in the bushes of Wright Park. I
hope you share my concern that Chloe might find a similar approach to
exploration outside the protection of a care-giver she strongly
respects.

Emily opposed Donna’s abstinence methodology of pregnancy prevention. I
believe it’s also the strict policy of the Mormon theology. Emily and I
discussed Chloe’s sex education. Emily said, “I don’t even think it’s
bad if she has a lot of partners. So long as she respects herself!” Her
views were in direct conflict with Mormon views. I do not believe Donna
Mairs shows self-respect in a consistent manner a primary care-giver
needs to model.

Emily left the Mormon church because she wished to date a particular
young man, and could not continue attending church while doing so.

Emily strongly disagreed with Mormon teaching about gays and lesbians,
and strong church opposition to their civil right of marriage. She
mentioned gay Marines who were friends to her in the Marine Corps. Emily
held values about not only sexual minorities but racial minorities that
Donna does not hold. Emily regularly relayed to me instances where Donna
expressed reservations and fears about people who are of African
descent, and I heard Donna do so. Emily felt these views were contrary
to the core values of the Marine Corps, and she did not want Chloe
exposed to them. I understand the racist history of the Mormon church. I
also understand the complexity involved when race and class collude in
oppression. Regardless of my understanding why Donna might show these
patterns, I do not want Chloe exposed to them, either.

In her adult life, despite holding on to some church values and
relationships with people who remained in the church, Emily was much
more a Marine than a Mormon.

The strong reasons why Emily chose me to raise Chloe Murphy include
shared values around theology and dogma.

59. Why did Ms. Murphy believe that all of her parents’ relationships were “fake?”
==================================================================================

Emily also called them “fake people” in conversation with my father.
Emily said her parents have “fake relationships” during her discussion
with Joni Irvin. Why did she see them this way? I can only speculate and
share the details she shared with me.

One detail she mentioned regularly about Darin and Mariela was their
apparent materialism. Between Donna and Richard, Emily noted the caustic
negativity and cynicism. It’s hard for me to answer on her behalf
because I think materialistic people get together, and cynical ones are
a match, too. However, I share Emily’s view that materialism is
inauthentic, a delusion about happiness.

Darin and Donna were married for about two decades. Emily said of Darin
that he is “really screwed up,” and that he “won’t let you know how he
really feels. He only shows you what he wants you to see.” I have
accumulated many examples of both Darin’s deceptiveness and his extreme
skills of emotional manipulation. His presentation is often contrary to
his actual views and feelings, i.e. extremely fake but expertly honed to
manipulate. If he maintained a marriage with these values that would
cause a lot of harm to his spouse, and it certainly seems fake.

Emily also objected to the static gender roles Donna and Richard
practiced. Richard never helped with housework, leaving Donna
overworked. Static gender roles are implicitly fake. Parties face the
obligation to embrace the housework/breadwinning and smile.

60. Explain why you stated that you operated largely without Ms. Murphy’s family’s help when you were performing Hospice care for Ms. Murphy.
=============================================================================================================================================

I welcomed people who came to help. Emily’s friends Bettina, Janette,
and Allison came and helped. My own family offered to help, and I
organized them into evening shifts. Darin Murphy offered to help exactly
once, and came to the apartment alone only four times, all briefly.
Twice he interacted briefly with me, once he served Emily’s unconscious
body with court papers, and once he briefly spoke with Emily. That was
it. He worked a five-minute walk from the apartment. He didn’t offer to
help with the hospice care.

Emily’s mother, Donna, showed up on occasion, but I could not delegate
medication to her. I asked Donna to feed Emily a Jell-o that included an
important medication. Donna got side-tracked and failed to complete the
feeding.

My family understood the importance of asking, “Is there anything I can
do,” but Emily’s family (with the exception of Jenny, and possibly
Melissa) didn’t. They would arrive without calling ahead, sneak into the
building, bypassing the call box. Sarah came with her 2 year old child
who peed on the floor wearing nothing while Sarah played Facebook games.
It might be meaningful for her to be present, but that’s not much help.
Only Jenny and to some degree Melissa took the time to learn how to care
for Emily with regard to cleanliness, food, medication, and hydration.
Her mother’s visits often left her in an agitated state. Her father
always seemed to have some ulterior motive. He acted like some kind of
authority even though he maintained a substantial distance from daily
activities. He would try to interrogate me, and make bizarre
accusations. For example, he read the prescription for rectal lorazepam
and claimed based on it that I was misusing oral lorazepam. Caregiver
Mariah relayed to me that Darin asked her strange questions about
medications, seeming to seek confirmation that Emily had been
mis-medicated or over-medicated. Mariah explained that he should address
the questions to me, as I was her medication care-giver, but he did not
ask me. Hospice notes indicated that they had high confidence in my
administration of all medication.

Hospice is a major medical situation. Some in the family were not
qualified to handle many of the details. Meanwhile, based on so many
indications of devious intent, emotional abuse, and apparent delusion or
paranoia, I was reluctant to trust the intentions or reliability of
others in Emily’s family, most especially her father.

Hospice intake Darin showed up in heavy fireman apparel, far exceeding
what must be needed for him to perform telephone answering duty. He
demeaned me in front of the nurse and social worker for failing to
inform him adequately. For example, he insisted that he should have been
informed about Emily’s seizure of March 23^rd^. He asserted that his
role as medical POA entitled him to deference as an authority in Emily’s
medical care. The social worker told me later that the care giver and
hospice work closely together until Emily becomes unconscious. Darin
asked under what circumstances 911 should be called and was told hospice
would be contacted first in all instances except life threatening
conditions. I think this bothered him, as later he explained that 911 Is
available for even minor matters including helping Emily from the floor.
He then said the transfer we were doing using a secure vertical bedside
bar and a gait belt to pivot to an in room commode was unsafe. I was
assured by hospice it was safe and my training was adequate. But
insisting conditions are unsafe is the primary—perhaps the only—tactic
Darin uses. To seek control if a situation.

So he insisted, again, his daughter was in danger, but did not arrive to
help her.

61. What in the family’s abusive psychology that caused this?
=============================================================

My uncle and Father have both described Darin’s technique as “emotional
starvation”, withholding affection and attention so you become starved
for it. Isolation plays a role in the family that I don’t quite
understand yet. Her family (with the exception of Jennifer) declined to
offer support of substance. It’s hard to say why.

Around January 25^th^, Donna said, “People say your love is better than
mine.” Sometimes I think she was jealous of my relationship with both
Emily and Chloe. Currently she refuses to let Chloe see adult members of
my family, suggesting isolation is a tactic, perhaps to starve
relationships that seem to compete with their own.

Emily said many times she wished she had their support. I believe they
withheld it for different reasons. Donna feared losing her own sense of
identity as a nurturer of children. Perhaps Donna fears being alone with
her husband in that big house, facing inevitable painful truths. I
believe Darin withheld his support in a bid to control Chloe’s
inheritance.

62. Did you talk Ms. Murphy into changing her will?
===================================================

Absolutely not!

63. Did you talk Ms. Murphy into taking guardianship of Chloe?
==============================================================

Absolutely not.

In fact I resisted her request over a number of years. On November
12^th^, 2013, I began strongly considering her request to do this. On
the day before Thanksgiving, 2013, I promised to do what she wanted, the
opposite of persuasion. John Kickman, an attorney, said guardianship
would “go a long way” if she were to die before the adoption was
completed.

Emily wanted me to raise Chloe since at least 2012, and asked me to
“stay in Chloe’s life” starting in 2009.

In Oct 2013 Emily told my half-brother I would raise Chloe, and he said
saying so made her happy.

64. During the time that Ms. Murphy changed her will, please list all of the treatment that she was on and all of the names of drugs that she was taking, the amount, and who prescribed them to her. When did Ms. Murphy change her will?
==========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Citalopram (Celexa) for depression, prescribed by the V.A. primary care
physician.

Levetiracetam (Keppra) 1500 mg/daily to prevent seizures, prescribed by
a Madigan doctor who specializes in seizure prevention.

Possibly bevacizumab (Avastin) to treat cancer cells, prescribed by her
oncology doctor, Dr. Myslivich.

If she was in chemotherapy treatment at this time it would only manifest
as tiredness for a day after the treatment. I do not believe she had
received chemotherapy on the day before the will was signed, as she
wouldn’t have had adequate energy. I would need Madigan medical records
to confirm this. I believe as executor I may have legal authority to get
them.

65. Do you believe that Ms. Murphy was competent when she changed her will? Why or why not?
===========================================================================================

Yes. I have known Emily for a long time. On the day that Emily signed
her will, she was as clear-minded as ever. We arrived early to the
attorney’s office so we parked and looked out on the water. Emily told
me that she resented the harassment from her father, and told me that
she wanted me to have all the tools I would need to keep her father from
interfering with her plan for Chloe.

Emily signed her will on the same day the 2^nd^ adoption meeting
occurred, so lots of people spoke with her and examined her that day. On
that particular day, she described the 2^nd^ adoption meeting as, “round
two”. This is consistent with her description of the 1^st^ adoption
meeting as “round one”. That’s not just competency. That’s a Marine’s
fighting spirit to protect her child through shrewd maneuvers guided by
gut instinct.

Emily was as normal on that particular day as ever. Emily was very
focused, strong-willed, and clear-minded well into May. Though the
aphasia condition sometimes made it look as if she had trouble, Emily
was both very conscious and extremely aware. I understand Darin and
others have claimed that I talked Emily into changing her will but I did
not. Emily made up her own mind. Additionally, please note that no one
filed a petition to contest Emily's will nor do I gain financially in
any way under Emily's will.

The following people met with Emily the day that she signed her will, so
you can ask them about Emily’s competency:

-   Brianne Kampbell, attorney, who interviewed her extensively with me
    absent from the room in an assessment of Emily’s competency
    before signing. Brianne Kampbell was well-aware of the allegations
    made by Darin Murphy.

-   Joyce Robson, attorney, who said on that day, “I believe you want
    John to adopt Chloe.”

-   Joni Irvin, Pierce County Adoption Coordinator

-   Herb Dempsey, Patricia Dempsey, and Jan Dempsey, who dined with
    Emily after the 2^nd^ adoption meeting. Over dinner Emily said
    something like, “I enjoy being with you guys. It’s no stress.”

Emily’s own parents disappeared after the meeting, declined to visit her
home with Joni Irvin and Joyce Robson, and declined the dine with us.

66. Please give a time line of when Ms. Murphy and Chloe lived with Emily’s parents.
====================================================================================

I believe she moved from her apartment to their house in 2010, and moved
out December 23^rd^, 2013, but nailing down the exact month she left her
apartment has been tough.

67. Please give a time line of when Ms. Murphy and Chloe lived with you.
========================================================================

December 24^th^2013, to May 15^th^, 2014.

68. Are you concerned that Donna, and her spouse, will not be able to financially afford to raise Chloe? Why or why not? 
=========================================================================================================================

Can Donna afford not to? I am aware of some details of Donna’s home
finances. Chloe comes with a trust as well as monthly benefits that
assures custody of her is not a financial burden, and is arguably a
fiscal asset.

I do question Donna’s judgement about finance.

Around 2010, Donna and Richard Mairs financed a major home remodel using
credit cards. The remodel was not completed and substantial debt
remained at unpleasant rates. In a meeting in Fall 2013, Darin expressed
concerns that benefits earned by Emily’s Marine service intended for
Chloe would instead finance Mairs home debt. The Mairs home is large. It
has housed 6 people. It now houses 3, at considerable expense.

Donna explained at the start of 2014 that the purchase of Richard’s
truck was based on overtime pay, which had since disappeared.

Darin, who knows Donna well, said he did not want to see Chloe’s
survivor benefit go to household debt.

Emily described a large freezer in the basement that was expensive to
operate while freezing little of value. (Acatch or kill from Greg
Uruqhart, a sportsman.)

Donna has failed to pay for 6 hours of visitation, and initially refused
to pay an additional \$10 for Halloween visitation. She received
\$100,000 in August from USAA life insurance, and receives monthly
checks designated as money for Chloe.

She’s pursuing a custody case likely to cost a fair chunk of those
funds. Her 3 court motions were vicious, expensive, and unsuccessful.
This money will be gone, the house will suck it away, and Chloe will
sustain the unsustainable mess at her expense.

When Donna received the \$100,000, she withdrew an offer to mediate a
solution, and pursued a legal strategy that nobody but her attorney
appeared to believe could work. My uncle heard Heather Young yelling
into her telephone, “I can’t believe I lost my motion!” Her attorney
might be aware of Donna’s ability to pay, and this might skew her
attorney’s judgment about winnability.

69. Why did a Hospice social worker state that you were no longer able to take care of Chloe? What was that person’s name, contact information, etc.?
=====================================================================================================================================================

Mernetha Rogers, MSW said I was not able to take care of Chloe because I
lacked “a clear state of mind and… was very, very overwhelmed.” She was
concerned I was “suffering from caregiver collapse and unable to handle
stressful situations.” In her declaration, Ms. Rogers specifies these
specific concerns:

-   Mr. Dempsey sat on the couch the entire time I was there and
    looked distraught.

-   Mr. Dempsey was tearful and appeared unable to handle the stress.

-   Mr. Dempsey said he “was fearful that he might lose it.”

-   Mr. Dempsey told me he had not slept or bathed, and his appearance
    seemed to confirm his statement.

-   Mr. Dempsey told me he could not care for Emily and Chloe at the
    same time.

-   Mr. Dempsey said he was concerned about the custody case
    involving Chloe.

Ms. Rogers is an employee of Franciscan Health Hospice and Palliative
Care.

70. Did you have a nervous breakdown due to exhaustion? When? Why? Where? Who is the professional that stated this? If so, what did you do to address this?
===========================================================================================================================================================

No professional has stated this. I think it’s something Darin Murphy
said once in a declaration. He is not a medical professional. I suffered
“caregiver collapse” according to a social worker for hospice.

To address my condition I sought “respite care” for Emily up to five
days in a professional care facility. I also discussed Emily’s POLST,
especially with the nurse managing the case. Full resuscitation is not a
service typically provided in hospice care. I had been studying CPR, but
what if Emily had a heart attack while I slept on the floor mattress?
Failing to monitor her heart and breathing becomes unethical as risk of
failures increase. I discussed these issues with the social worker, and
examined a list of full time care facilities where Emily could get the
care she needed. However, Darin intervened to relocate Emily to his
home, and then displayed a POLST at her bedside that specified DNR. He
had signed this form but a physician had not.

A few days after Emily moved, CPS took Chloe from school. Devastated, I
relocated to my half-brother’s house. My half-sister spent the night on
the floor beside me and both she and my half-brother walked me around
the neighborhood. My brother took Emily’s car keys. My father brought
protein shakes that assure nutrients. On May 31 I visited the urgent
care facility in Seattle and was prescribed clonazepam. I followed up
with Dr. Tobias Dang who prescribed Lexapro and referred me to see Paul
Vanderzee who engaged in behavioral therapy with me over 3 therapy
sessions. I had one session with another therapist, for a total of 4
sessions. I attended adult therapy at Gilda’s Club and also returned to
the cancer support group where I began this journey last year at this
time. I worked hard to recover, walking, eating right, and talking with
friends, family, and therapists.

71. What are the effects of short term and long term memory with a person that had brain cancer like Ms. Murphy’s? Explain in detail as it applied to Ms. Murphy.
=================================================================================================================================================================

I am not a physician or health care provider, so this question is beyond
my expertise. Additionally, I do not quite understand question. I do not
believe that short term or long term memory affects a person with brain
cancer; it is probably the other way around. Emily Murphy had
progressive brain cancer, which affected her memory. It deteriorated
over time, to the point where I’d call it moderate. Nevertheless, I do
not believe that Emily's judgment was impaired concerning Chloe. Emily
told me in 2012 that she wished for me to be Chloe’s dad, and never said
anything different. She tried throughout 2013 to persuade me to move to
Tacoma and raise Chloe, and eventually she succeeded. It was only within
the last month of Emily's life that I noticed her opinion shifting
occasionally on various things, then shifting back, but she never
wavered about Chloe’s future. Her position about me raising Chloe was
consistent back to 2012. In July, 2012, she wrote: “Thank you for being
Chloe's Dad. I just wanted to express my admiration for you and what you
did and will continually do for Chloe. I know it will not end.”

72. How does brain cancer and all of the various drugs and therapies that were employed, affect Ms. Murphy’s decision making abilities at the time when she changed her will? Explain in detail.
================================================================================================================================================================================================

I am not a physician or health care provider, so this question is beyond
my expertise. At the time Emily Murphy changed her will, she was taking
an anti-depressant and an anti-seizure medication. Based on my
observations neither of those medications impacted her decision-making
(except positively). Nor did Emily's brain cancer impact her
decision-making. Emily made sound decisions up until the end of my care
for her. At the time she signed her will, she managed banking, logistics
of walking around the neighborhood (sometimes with assistance), school
matters including Chloe’s awards assembly, decision-making about what
treatments she wished to receive and how she wished to die. Emily said
that dying means losing control, and she did not want any control of her
life taken from her. I promised to honor all of her wishes in that
conversation and others.

Emily suffered from a condition called aphasia that was induced by the
brain tumors. Aphasia is an inability to *speak*, an inability to *find
the right words*, not an inability to *think*. This was confirmed to me
by Dr. Natalie Dong, who described Emily as clear-minded in early
January when we met with her. At the time she changed her will, Emily
enjoyed complex television shows featuring court and mystery-oriented
plots, and regularly sang with Chloe and me. Prior to entrance in
hospice, she began experiencing dizziness, but showed no sign of
impaired decision-making. At no time did I believe Emily lacked
decision-making abilities, and so I continued respecting all of her
decisions. This is also exactly what hospice did. I know you keep asking
about her condition when she changed her will, rather than a month prior
or a month after, but I am saying she experienced moderate changes in
physical well-being which did not impair her decision-making abilities
until very near to her death, when she couldn’t really make decisions
because of paralysis, but communicated clearly when awake by blinking
eyes or squeezing her good hand in mine. Her decisions remained
consistent, and I remain committed to honoring them.

Additionally, please note that no one has filed a petition to contest
Emily Murphy's will, and the time to do so has elapsed. Thus, Emily's
family apparently concurs that she had capacity when she executed the
codicil to her will.

73. Are you concerned that Donna will not be able to physically care for Chloe? Why or why not?
===============================================================================================

Yes. Chloe is a very active little girl, and I have concern that the
Mairs will not be able to physically care for her. I have a large body
of photos showing Chloe engaging with me in outdoor activities,
including swimming, boating, hitting a birthday piñata. I have not seen
Donna engage in these activities with Chloe, either directly or through
photographs.

Donna is severely diabetic, and requires constant insulin through a
machine. She is often lethargic, and seems disconnected from
conversation. At times Donna also seems emotionally disassociated. Emily
said Donna frequently “collapses” due to low blood sugar. Chloe has
described “near hospitalization” conditions from blood sugar extremes.
Putting Chloe in front of a television qualifies as care in Donna’s
home. But this is about a highly intelligent child who is creative and
enjoys “coloring outside the lines.” Additionally, what Donna may be
able to do for Chloe physically has very little to do with what Chloe
needs intellectually, spiritually, creatively and emotionally. I also do
not believe that Donna has anywhere near the energy or enthusiasm I
have. If you lower the bar quite a bit, then Donna can “care for” Chloe.
What’s best for Chloe?

Similarly, Richard Mairs plays video games and watches home improvement
programs a lot on TV. I have only rarely seen Richard leave his
recliner, usually for dinner.

74 .Why have you refused to give Ms. Murphy’s personal items back to her family?
================================================================================

I’ve only been asked for the cellular telephone. This device is tied
closely to my obligation to Emily. The telephone contains access codes
imprinted in electronic memory. Any other property I may have could not
be worth more than \$100, and I haven’t been asked for any of it. In any
case, the probate of Emily's estate remains open and all of the assets
in the estate belong to Chloe.

75. Explain in detail your style of discipline when it comes to Chloe. Do you believe that your style of discipline is effective? Where did you learn this style of discipline?
===============================================================================================================================================================================

Discipline has many meanings, including structure, punishment, and
encouragement toward worthwhile goals.

One technique I used to enforce structure with Chloe was the
availability of internet in the house. The internet would turn off for
the entire house at 7pm, with her bedtime at 8pm. This enforced order to
school nights.

Another discipline technique I used was the removal of internet, using a
plug that was visible but out of Chloe’s reach. I explained to Chloe
that the “no no game,” a form of obstructionism I believe she learned
and continues to learn from Donna Mairs, would result in immediate
unplugging of the internet. There was no double-standard at work with
this technique, because the plug turned off internet for everyone. Chloe
would get dramatic, saying she’s terribly bored, and I would explain
there are so many activities she could engage in, from reading to
playing ukulele to drawing to playing badminton with me. I strongly
believe in active vs. passive amusement, and taught her the difference.
I saw a pattern where she would become belligerent when exposed to too
much passive amusement, and I took steps to control her exposure to it.
I insisted she understand there are many amusements available, even with
the internet off, and she couldn’t rationally claim to be deprived or
totally without opportunity for amusement. It just required a little
intentional effort. Usually she would engage in something eventually and
have fun with it for a while. Passive amusement is addictive and should
be treated as such.

When Chloe was younger, I gave her swats. These only occurred when she
engaged in behavior that was dangerous, and was already communicated to
her to be dangerous.

I don’t know where I learned these things. I have some exposure to
educational environments, and remember promising myself as a young
person that when I’m an adult I would remember what it’s like to be a
child. I believe this translated into a commitment to fairness,
openness, listening, and supportiveness toward young people.

One of the reasons I consider both Darin and Donna to be harmful to
children is because they criticize my interpersonal techniques with
Chloe, while practicing harmful techniques themselves. Darin has argued
that my affection and support for Chloe is actually a devious, dangerous
relationship of harm, while he himself engages very little with Chloe,
and readily spanks or threatens to spank her. Donna has argued that I am
simply child-like, irrelevant to Chloe’s actual needs, and unable to
comprehend what parenthood entails. Later Donna said during therapy that
I am actually stricter than she had believed, and that’s correct: I
allow broad exploration within safe and healthy boundaries, and I
strictly prohibit activity outside those boundaries.

Chloe needs an enlightened form of discipline, which understands her
incredible intelligence, creativity, and desire to explore. She also
needs a care-giver attuned to her unique needs as a child who has lost
her mother. I suppose I understand some of this because I am
intelligent, creative, and adventuresome. Being “different” as a child
is frustrating and often unfair, regardless of how or why you’re
different.

I want Chloe to have a normal childhood in which she is expected and
empowered to perform to her potential, explore according to her
interests, and experience positive reinforcement attuned to her needs.

From a very young age, Chloe has appreciated when I explained the rules
and boundaries to her. For example, during Darin’s wedding in his home,
I explained that lemonade has a lot of sugar in it, so we aren’t
bringing any into the livingroom, because any spill on the carpet would
attract ants, a problem in that house. To my surprise, Chloe hugged me,
as she often did when I explained *why* various prohibitions to behavior
exist.

Over the years I’ve employed these techniques of healthy discipline:

Give choices / suggest desirable alternatives, ignore misbehavior, find
age-appropriate activities (where most of her impulses are acceptable
and encouraged), confidently assert positive authority to gain
cooperation, identify emotional nuances (stay attuned to how she feels),
listen, respond with honesty, including emotional honesty, while using
language she can understand, be loyal (so she understands the unpleasant
moments and the fun times are all part of the same relationship in which
I show loyalty to her, and she has consistently shown it to me), respect
her as an individual with wishes and unique characteristics.

76. Why did you keep the proposed adoption a secret from Ms. Murphy’s family? 
==============================================================================

I did not. I advised Darin Murphy (Emily Murphy’s father) of my intent
to adopt Chloe in San Francisco in late November, 2013 with Mariela
(Darin's wife), Melissa (Emily's sister), and Emily in the room. I
repeated my intent to Darin again in early January 2014. Emily informed
Donna Mairs (her mother) in early December.

77. Have you called the police twice telling them that Donna is kidnapping Chloe? Please provide the police reports. 
=====================================================================================================================

No, I did not.

To kidnap is to take illegally and by force. This is not a word I’ve
used or events I ever believe took place. I called police twice with
regard to the custody of Chloe. I made the first call when darkness was
approaching and Chloe had not been returned home from school. Donna
Mairs (Emily Murphy's mother) had told me she would bring Chloe home
right after school, which ended three hours prior. Donna did not answer
her cellular or home phone. I called my sister Jan Dempsey to ask what
to do. She strongly suggested I call the police. Emily agreed with this
course of action. When the police arrived, Emily placed the report. That
report is a matter of record. I do not have it now. I have the incident
number, but haven’t been able to locate it yet.

The second call to police was to defuse and mediate a conflict occurring
in Donna Mair’s home and yard. I described this incident in the previous
intake, and incorporate it here. After Donna understood Chloe was in my
custody, she asked me to call the police back to cancel the call, and I
did.

78. Give me a clear and detailed time line of where Chloe has lived since she first met you and how often that you had contact with her during that time. 
==========================================================================================================================================================

For the first six or so months that I dated Emily, Chloe lived with
Emily in a small apartment. She relocated to Donna’s home where she
lived until December 24^th^, 2013. In late May, 2014, she relocated
again to Donna’s home. I refer you to Answer \#20 for details about how
often I’ve been in contact with Chloe since we met.

79. Have you ever become aroused while playing with Chloe? Why is this one of the allegations that has been made against you? Who made this allegation, when and where? Could you address this allegation in your own words?
============================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Chloe and I have a father-daughter relationship. She has not ever
aroused me erotically or in any inappropriate manner. I believe you are
referring to a claim made by Andrea Mattsen (Emily's elderly
grandmother) that I inappropriately touched Chloe when we were in
Mexico. There was no inappropriate conduct. The only time I spent with
both Andrea and Chloe was in Mexico and the evening before leaving for
Mexico, so that must be where she claimed to witness the alleged abuse.
That was in late December 2012.

Andrea Mattsen's perceptions of my contact with Chloe are inaccurate.
For example, over a year after I last saw her while with Chloe in
Mexico, she left a voicemail with Emily claiming that I had been
sexually assaulting Chloe “for a long time.” On what basis could she
make this claim? Then she said “we need to get Chloe in a room and tell
her it’s ok to talk about it.” Andrea had a distant relationship with
Emily and spent no time with us except once when we visited her. On that
occasion, without Chloe present, I spoke with Andrea at length about
horses and her life. She did not seem to recognize me as anyone in
particular. This is consistent with most of my brief interactions with
her at family events. She’d throw me a smile and cheerful look. She did
not appear to greet me as a person responsible for a sexual assaults and
erections during play with a child. If Andrea Mattsen witnessed these
things, why didn’t she prepare a declaration in the interveners’ case? I
think the answer is because she is not a reliable witness. Her own son,
Darin Murphy, explained during Bridges therapy that Andrea was becoming
“manic”, making demands about shopping and generally bossing him around.
I believe that Darin rejected these allegations except where it suited
his effort to sabotage Chloe’s relationship with me.

Additionally, Chloe has never reported such an event, even though Andrea
says it involved fighting me off. This allegedly occurred January 1,
2013. But Chloe had stayed overnight on January 1, 2013, with Mariela's
family at Mariela’s cousin’s. When I came to Brazil Street that day, I
stayed with Mariela’s aunt and spoke with her uncle, parents to the
cousin. When Chloe returned from Mariela’s cousin’s house, we
immediately jumped in the truck for the airport. It was pouring down
rain. Yet allegedly had time to step outside in the torrent of rain and
savagely sexually assault Chloe on January 1^st^, according to Andrea
Mattsen.

Andrea Mattsen called Emily and said "the abuse had been going on a long
time. We have to get Chloe in a room and tell her it's ok to talk about
it." Due to her lack of contact with me, Andrea had no ability to
observe any alleged ongoing abuse.
