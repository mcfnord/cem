> On Februa.ry 14^b^ 2011 the respondent and I appeared for trial. We
> had attended a previous mediation meeting in which a settlement was
> not reached. We were granted a new ü•ial date of June 22^nd^ 2011 due

>
> Following that day I received a letter stating the Respondent would no

>
> I was later notified the Respondent had not paid my Automobile

> I do not have any legal repr•entation and can not afford any.

2.2 Reasons why the Injury may be Irreparable

> This injury may be irreparable because:
>
> a). Petitioner's safety and privacy are at risk for Irreparable
> damage.
>
> b). Community Property Asset Invesünent Accounts totaling over
> \$400,000.00 are jeopardized and at risk of being liquidated due to
> continual denied access of the petitioner. Once liquidated the assets
> will be gone.
>
> c).Community Property Assets valued at over \$125,000.00 are being
> hidden and risk being liquidated, sold or moved. Once liquidated they
> can not be replaced.
>
> d\) Community property assets have already been used, liquidated, put at
> risk and lost.
>
> e). Lapses in entitled Automobile Insurance coverage could cause
> irreparable damage to everyone.
>
> f). Properties, homes and credit standings are at risk for loss and
> with long term effects.
>
> g ). Respondent is a clear Flight risk outside the country. Once gone
> with liquidated assets and responsibility to debt obligations the
> damage is irreparable.

2.3 Clear and Convincing Reasons why Weapons Should be Surrendered
------------------------------------------------------------------

> \[x\] The \[x\] respondent should be required to surrender any deadly
> weapons as requested in paragraph I .3 because of following clear and
> convincing reasons:

a.  Possessing an arsenal of weapons of this magnitude combined with his
    > behavioral problems poses a threat to the Petitioner and safety
    > of others.

b.  allowing a minor who is not a resident to irresponsibly display and
    > use a dangerous firearm while under Respondents guidance is a
    > danger

> c). The respondent is hiding, moving and liquidating over \$125,000.00
> in Community Property Assets that once disposed of will not be able to
> be replaced.
>
> Petitioners (SEALCR Exhibit B)
>
> I am asking for relief and the courts assistance in securing this
> until final decree is entered so I am allowed to live in a safe
> environment and assets are not liquidated . Respondent has repeatedly
> alleged I am in possession of them despite documented evidence. I ask
> that all weapons be surrendered to the Pierce County Sherriff for this
> reason in order to secure this case until final. Once final further
> protection will be sought.

### 2.4 Reasons for a Temporary Order

> ![](img/media/image22.jpg){width="0.15481846019247594in"
> height="0.13987314085739283in"}It is necessary' that the court issue a
> temporary order with the relief requested in paragraph I .4 above for
> the reason set forth below:
>
> a). Agreed on debt divisions were arranged at the beginning of this
> case and should stand. Respondent has repeatedly used this to
> manipulate, threaten and cause stress to me in this case, It is clear
> from past history in this case Respondent will not abide unless there
> is an order.
>
> b). Respondent is using community property assets to travel, purchase
> properties and other Extraordinary expenditures, start new businesses,
> hide income and is a flight risk outside of the country. (Petitioners
> Exhibit E) (SEALFN Exhibit B3 )
>
> c\) Respondent has taken funds that were to be divided equally between
> parties and liquidated joint accounts. (Petitioners SEALFN D)
>
> d). Respondent eams in excess of \$11,000.00 a month compared to
> Petitioners \$1500.00\$1800.00. Community Properties and Community
> Acquired Debt obligations are at risk without temporary orders. I am
> unable to afford mortgage, home equity line, vehicle and

>
> (Petitioners SEALFN Exhibit B I -B2-B3)
>
> e). I am not able to afford an attorney and to date have spent over
> \$30,000.00 in Attomey fees. I have had to live on credit just to meet
> my basic needs after being left with little money to live on after the
> agreed on debt division meeting held in April 2009. To date I have
> accrued over \$40,000.00 in credit debt as result of Respondents
> manipulation and refusing to settle this case . I cannot pay my
> medical bills and my excellent credit history of 30 years is being
> destroyed by Respondents failure to make agreed on debt payments.
> (Petitioners SEALFN Exhibit C)

##### BACKGROUND INFORMATION

> You and your union representative, President Pat McElligott, Local 3
> 1, met with Battalion Chief Gary Steinhoffon Thursday, December 27,
> 2007, to discuss three issues:
>
> ![](img/media/image266.jpg){width="0.12954396325459316in"
> height="1.0516491688538934in"}I . The unauthorized computer rputer
> that you had connected to the City network. You admitted that the
> router belonged to you, and you explained that you allegedly used it
> one time to access the City network and the Internet from Station 8 to
> research information for a project for certification.

2.  A USB cable attached to the IDC of Engine 8 that you admitted was
    your cable and that you had attached to listen to music.
    ![](img/media/image222.jpg){width="9.965004374453194e-3in"
    height="9.968285214348206e-3in"}

3.  ![](img/media/image267.jpg){width="0.11479768153980753in"
    height="1.7875623359580053in"}A File Synchronization message upon
    Station 8 computer log out informing users that the files were
    synchronized with your files. You stated you were unaware how and
    why this was happening. This issue arose when the files from the
    computers located at Stations 8 and 13 were synchronized to copy
    files to a Dmurphy file. An investigation into this issue determined
    that the synchronization had been set up on the computers so that
    the files were being copied to your personal H Drive on the
    TFD network. You are the only person with access to your H Drive,
    and only you could set up the file synchronization. You stated to
    Battalion Chief Steinhoffthat you had seen this message on the
    computer and had been asked about it by station personnel, but that
    you had not altered or changed any settings on the computer and you
    did not know why it was happening. Although this issue had been
    brought to your attention as a supervisor, you made no effort to
    address the problem.

> On March 3, 2005, you signed an acknowledgment that you had received,
> read, and understood the City's Internet Use Policy, and that, as a
> City employee, you are subject to its provisions. The acknowledynent
> further stated that you understood that inappropriate use of the
> Inter-net may lead to disciplinary action, up to and including
> termination.

> acknowledgment that you had received, read, and understood the City's
> Email and Computer Use Policy, and that, as a City employee, you are
> subject to the provisions therein. The acknowledgment further stated
> that inappropriate use of . . . Internet access, and computer files
> could be monitored and examined at any time.

##### REASONS FOR MY CONTEMPLATED DECISION

> As a Lieutenant, you are expected to be a role model for your crew.
> You are expected to obey the rules and to show good judgment. unstead,
> in this case, you have shown poor judgrnent and demonstrated
> carelessness concerning rules that were inconvenient to you.\] Your
> actions demonstrate a lack of leadership.
>
> When station personnel brought the synchronization message problem to
> your attention, it was your responsibility to resolve it because you
> are an officer and because you were the recipient named in the
> message. Your failure to do so was a failure of leadership. In
> addition, wireless technology is not secure enough to ensure
> protection of vital TFD and City software, hardware, and data. By
> using the router, you could have and may have seriously comprised the
> City electronic data systems. See, for example, the City Wireless
> Technology Use Policy (enclosed). Certainly, if all employees were
> allowed to use personal equipment with City systems, such as your üse
> of the router and USB cable, the City would lose control over the
> integrity of the systems. Damage could occur. It would not be possible
> to determine the source of problems encountered.
>
> ![](img/media/image269.jpg){width="0.7745428696412948in"

>
> ou have dfrectly violated a special order specifically stating that
> you are not to attach any devices, including routers, nor any
> hardware, including cables to the network. The rule was clear, the
> violation obvious, the excuses given disappointing.
>
> our explanation regarding the USB cable—that it was attached to enable
> you to listen to music through the MDC—is not an impressive excuse.
>
> Nor does your explanation as to the router-—that it was used only one
> time off duty to access the City network Internet for certification
> work—provide a satisfactory excuse. You violated a clear mandate to
> solve a problem that could seemingly be solved in many appropriate
> ways.
>
> This cavalier use of City equipment and the uninspiring explanations
> therefore both disappoint me and cause me to lose trust in your
> ability to properly respect station equipment and lead your current
