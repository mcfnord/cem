## IN THE SUPERIOR COURT FOR THE STATE OF WASHINGTON
 
### IN AND FOR THE COUNTY OF PIERCE

Respondent Emily Murphy: Visitation should be as follows:

The petitioner, respondent Emily Murphy and the child 	reside together in Pierce County, Washington.

There should be no change in respondent Emily Murphy's 	visitation and contact with the child.
		
Respondent Kyle Coker:  Parental visitation should be limited because respondent Kyle Coker has engaged in the conduct which follows:

Willful abandonment that continues for an extended 
period of time or substantial refusal to perform 
parenting functions.
	
Respondent Kyle Coker has not seen the child since she was an infant and, with the exception of paying child support, has had no involvement with her.

Respondent, Kyle Coker, has never had physical custody of 
the child.  

Respondent Kyle Coker is not a suitable custodian for the 
child because he has had no contact with the child since she 
was an infant, is not bonded with the child nor familiar 
with her ongoing needs.

Respondent Kyle Coker resides in the state of Florida.

The child has resided in the state of Washington for several 
years, and there is substantial evidence available in this 
state concerning the child's care, protection, training and 
personal relationships.

Respondent Emily Murphy, the child's mother, has been a 
suitable parent until recently.

Respondent Emily Murphy has developed significant health 
issues that prevent her from properly caring for the child 
or being a suitable custodian for her.

Respondent Emily Murphy's health issues are imminent and 
terminal.

Petitioner is Emily Murphy's significant other.

Petitioner has been surrogate father for the child for 
several years, and is closely bonded with her. 

The child is close to the petitioner and calls him "Dad."

Petitioner performs the majority of the parenting functions 
for the child and provides for the child, and is willing to 
continue to do so.

Respondent Emily Murphy asked the petitioner to file 
a related adoption petition and has joined in this petition 
in order to ensure that the child is protected, that the 
child's needs are met and that the child has the stability 
and continuity that she will need in the event of her 
mother's death.
		
### Best Interest of the Child

The requests made in this petition are in the best interests of the child because:

The child has no relationship with respondent Kyle Coker.

The petitioner and respondent Emily Murphy began dating when the child was not quite two years old.

At the time petitioner and respondent Emily Murphy began dating, petitioner formed a strong relationship with the child.

Since that time the petitioner and the child have seen each other on a regular basis.

There was a lapse in time when the petitioner and respondent Emily Murphy were not dating, however, the petitioner's visitation and contact with the child continued throughout that time.

Respondent Emily Murphy has a terminal illness that has recently worsened to the point that she can no longer properly care for the child.

In December 2013, the petitioner, the respondent Emily Murphy and the child began living together, and the petitioner assumed the majority of parenting functions associated with raising the child.

The child calls the petitioner "Dad" and is closely bonded with him.

The petitioner loves the child as if she were his own child, and is willing and able to provide for her.  

Due to the uncertainty of respondent Emily Murphy's medical status, the child needs the continued support and security which the petitioner has provided and can provide for her, and is more than willing to do so.
 
The child's mother, respondent Emily Murphy, believes that 	
it is in the child's best interest for petitioner to adopt 	
the child or, at a minimum, to be the 	child's legal 
custodian or guardian.

Of Attorneys for Petitioner

## Identifying Information and Referral:

Emily Murphy is a 32 year old Caucasian female referred to Options for a Mini-Mental State Examination to assist with the decision making 
process for custody of her 6 year old daughter.  Emily was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer and is seeking placement of her biological 
daughter.  Emily reported no significant psychological history and graduated with an associate’s degree prior to the cancer diagnosis.  The 
examination was completed at Emily’s home due to pain and physical limitations due to the brain tumors.  During the evaluation some 
accommodations in environment were made due to her high level of pain and poor motor skills in her dominant hand.

## Mini-Mental State Examination

Testing results of the MMSE show that Emily scored 24 of 30 points which suggests that Emily currently suffers mild cognitive impairment.  
However, upon further examination 4 of the 7 points missed were in the attention and calculation section which suggests that sustained 
attention and sustained complicated calculations are difficult for her.  On all other subtests she was able to complete the sections without 
difficulty missing only 3 other points.  During the writing of a sentence and drawing portion of the examination the items were difficult to 
read due to her problems with motor coordination and using the non-dominant hand.  However the sides of the figures were correct and the 
writing made a complete sentence despite being difficult to read.  Overall results suggest mild impairment in complex and sustained 
calculations.  All other portions of the examination were within normal limits suggesting only mild impairment.

**Letter to Jason**

Sorry to tell you Emily had a tough night of vomiting and serious headache.  The serious headache is a new concern.
 
The Hospice number in the kitchen will take your call and a nurse can call you back. Patent is: Emily Rose Murphy, Birthday Nov 7, 1981.

Nobody goes into my office. Keep the door closed and light off.

The attendant can help do everything except choose medications. The attendant can pass medications to Emily that you provide. I have a specific list of medications and times in the kitchen.

Log all medications given on the kitchen log.

Keep Emily’s head elevated as high as she allows.
The “comfort kit“ of medications are narcotics, so they aren’t in the kitchen.
 
If she begins vomiting, get a lorazipan from the top shelf black lock box in my office. Soak it in a spoon of water for 60 seconds and turn it into a paste (or just soften it). Put this under her tongue/on her gums.
If she has a serious headache, get an oxycodone from the same lock box. Soak it in a spoon of water for 60 seconds and turn it into a paste (or just soften it). Put this under her tongue/on her gums. PREVENT headaches rather than treating them by giving her an adequate and sustained dose of oxycodone. This also PREVENTS nausea.

Guests must be approved, and must whisper.
 
Emily is not likely to have a seizure, but during a seizure, hold her and assure you won’t leave her. Afterwards, pull the oxygen machine in Chloe’s room away from the wall, turn it on, and feed it into her nose. Immediately provide 2 anti-seizure suppositories from the kitchen.

If the room gets hot, open the window completely for a while. (Remove the stick that blocks it shut.)

### MOTION

Order that John Dempsey, the petitioner herein, by 
authorized to access the child's school and medical records, 
and to consent to any educational programs on behalf of the 
child and to any medical treatment that the child may need, 
including obtaining current immunizations for her and 
registering/enrolling the child in camps and therapy 
programs.

Respondent Kyle Coker should also be required to appear 
and show cause why the court should not enter a temporary 
order which:

Grants the petitioner custody of the following 	child:  Chloe Murphy.
	
John R. Dempsey states:

I am the petitioner in this nonparental custody action.  	
Respondent Emily Murphy is my significant other.  The minor 	child, Chloe Murphy, is Emily's daughter.  Respondent Kyle 	
Coker is Chloe's father.

I am Chloe Murphy's surrogate father. I have known Chloe since she was almost two years old. Chloe is now six. She calls me "Dad."  

Emily Murphy and I have been in a relationship for several years.  Emily has terminal brain cancer. We recently moved in together so that I could assist with Emily's care and take care of Chloe.  Our plan is for me to take care of Chloe after Emily passes away.

Emily has consented to my request to adopt Chloe, and joined in my petition to obtain custody of her. Additionally, Emily signed a power of attorney for health care (Exhibit "A" hereto) in which she designated me as guardian for Chloe and authorized me to make health care decisions for Chloe.

Kyle Coker is Chloe's father. He lives in Florida, and has not seen Chloe since she was an infant.  Like Emily, Mr. Coker signed a written consent for me to adopt Chloe.

Issues developed in the adoption case when one of Emily's family members alleged that I had sexually abused Chloe.  I steadfastly deny all such allegations. Emily denied the allegations. Child Protective Services investigated and determined that the allegations were unfounded. I have requested a full copy of CPS' records and will provide those to the Court upon receipt. Nevertheless, the adoption has not been finalized.

Due to concerns about Emily's continued ability to care for Chloe, I commenced this action so that I could obtain legal custody of Chloe.  Emily joined in the petition.  Mr. Coker has been served, yet has not filed a response. I believe that he is concerned about having to pay child support.  

Emily receives HOSPICE care in our apartment. Her condition has worsened. Emily is fighting hard against the cancer, but she is close to being incapacitated. 

Emily can no longer actively participate in raising Chloe. I perform all of the parenting functions for Chloe. I take Chloe to and from school. I make sure that Chloe goes to Bridges and Gilda's Club therapy programs for bereavement and cancer support. I talk with counselors, therapists and social workers to understand Chloe's needs. I ensure that Chloe is fed, dressed and that her other needs are met.

I am at the point that I need legal authority to take care of Chloe.  I am concerned that Emily's designation of me as guardian for Chloe is not sufficient. By way of example, Chloe would benefit from attending the Gilda cancer camp this summer and needs updated immunizations to do so.  At a minimum I cannot enroll Chloe in the camp.  

Chloe is only six years old.  She needs continued the stability that I have provided for her, especially given the pending loss of her mother.  Ex parte restraining orders are 
necessary in order to maintain the status quo and to provide the greatest protection to Chloe.

# See Death


## June 2, 2014

Emily had died some hours earlier and my wife, Pat, and I drove my son John Dempsey to visit Emily's remains at the home of Darin Murphy in Ruston.  Emily's remains were in bed in a small room off the living room and after viewing the remains Pat suggested we give the two of them some time alone.
Darin said, "Sure we can talk out on the porch."  We all went out to the porch where we stood silently for about 20 min. watching the neighbor’s construction project and doing very little talking.  After about 20 min. of standing there, I looked at Pat and said, ”Perhaps somebody should go in and check on John."

Darin immediately folded his arms across his chest, bowed his neck and said, "I wish you wouldn't!"  The move was sudden.  The anger was real and we both looked at him like he had totally slipped over the edge.  He seemed to realize that he had somehow been inappropriate and he immediately began shaking his head and saying, "That's not what I meant.  We continued to look at him as if he were plainly nuts and I said,  “It's your house you can do whatever you want to."

The environment was charged with tension as we waited and after a couple of minutes he finally said, "Yes, why don't you go and check on John?"  Pat went back into the house and a couple of minutes later appeared with John we walked to the car and left.

I would suggest anyone dealing with Darin Murphy treat him with the utmost respect as he is volatile and appears perpetually angry.  I have known subject Murphy since we operated separate electronic bulletin board systems in the 1980’s.   Herb Dempsey (former owner of MASTER CONTROL)

Health Services, Division of Children and Family Services

IN RE: Chloe Elizabeth Murphy DOB - 27 June 2007

Grief Counseling related to the death of Emily Rose Murphy DATE: 21 July
2014

At some point something has to be said. I do not know what can come as a
result of having made this request but I do have some idea of what could
happen if it is not written.

Emily Rose Murphy, now deceased, was someone with whom I had held
multiple conversations over a period of five years. Emily was working to
become a methodical protector of the future of her daughter Chloe
Elizabeth Murphy. Emily had terminal brain cancer and died on 1 June
2014. In over a year leading to her death Emily had worked to provide
counseling and to draw a path to dealing with her death for Chloe. She
regularly and routinely visited, with John Dempsey and Chloe, grief
counseling at Bridges in Tacoma and at Gilda's Club
in Seattle where all three were members. As a part of that counseling
Chloe had been accepted into the Tacoma Camp Sparkle to be held 11-14
August 2014 from 9:30 AM to 4 PM. 

On 21 June 2014 Chloe announced that her grandmother would not allow her
to attend Camp Sparkle.

On 19 May 2014 Chloe was seized at school and placed in state custody.
When John Dempsey arrived to pick her up from school she was already in
state custody. Two days later Chloe missed her first scheduled
appointment in the grief counseling process developed by her mother and
Dempsey. The next scheduled appointments were also missed and the trips
to Gilda’s club went unattended.

On 11 July 2014 Chloe stated she did not need to nor want to eat anymore
because her mother was dead. Emily wanted the best for Chloe and spent
over a year developing the habit and expectation of regularly having
trusted adults who could talk about death and dying and grief and
acceptance. Emily had attended multiple counseling sessions and provided
a regular schedule to be followed after her death. The transition
pattern Emily established has apparently been disrupted and not without
serious consequences. I do not know when child neglect becomes abuse and
when abuse becomes criminal but I do know this is not good for Chloe
Elizabeth Murphy and I do know her mother feared her death and the
child’s current placement would have such effects on a six year old. If
this request would be better received as a complaint please feel free to
contact me.

I feel that Chloe’s attendance at Camp Sparkle could work toward giving
her the will to live that she currently says she does not have. I have
attached the enrollment records for Camp Sparkle and I strongly urge
someone with more smarts than I work to assure that Chloe gets to
attend.

## IN THE SUPERIOR COURT FOR THE STATE OF WASHINGTON

Wherein Kyle lies:

1.13 Paragraph 1.13 is denied because Respondent Kyle Coker is a
suitable custodian for the child
as he has repeatedly attempted to be an influential part of Chloe
Murphy’s life but was
prevented by the Respondent Emily Murphy.

Petitioner John Dempsey’s performance of parental functions for the
child were brought into
questions repeatedly, thus resulting in several investigations by CPS.
These investigations
resulted in CPS contacting Respondent Kyle Coker for permission to
remove Chloe Murphy
out of John Dempsey’s care when it was determined that Respondent Emily
Murphy no longer
retained the mental faculties required to make a sound decision
regarding the care and wellbeing
of Chloe Murphy.

Determination of Respondent Emily
Murphy’s mental
capabilities at the time of expressing a belief of Chloe Murphy’s future
needs and requirements
is under question. Furthermore such a statement is of personal opinion
and cannot be entered as
factual.

Respondent Kyle Coker requests that he be found competent and capable as
Guardian of Chloe E.
Murphy, and that Chloe Murphy be place into Kyle Coker’s care.

Respondent Kyle Coker further requests that John Dempsey have no further
contact with the Child as he
possesses a potential threat to her physical and mental wellbeing.

**Respondent also requests that any and all monetary trusts or funds left
to Chloe Murphy by her
mother for any future requirements be place in a trust governed by the
maternal grandparents, Donna Mairs and Darin Murphy.**

*There you go, their plan to get the money and you, by turning Kyle into a hand puppet!*

Temporary Custody of Chloe Murphy to Richard and Donna Mairs until such
time as
proper and permanent placement of the child can be determined.

*"We'll get around to that part later!"*

Termination of all forms of visitation and/or communication between
Petitioner John Dempsey and Chloe Murphy.

*All of the sudden, Kyle says he cares! Or is this Kyle at all? Just a puppet?*

Allow full unrestricted visitation and communication rights between
Respondent Kyle Coker and Chloe Murphy.

*Kyle told the court he wants to communice with you. Did he?*

Enter antiharassent Order for Protection protecting
*Chloe Elizabeth Murphy* from *John R. Dempsey*.

*Somehow, Kyle gets his shit together in Florida and talks sooo tough about separating Chloe and John. Or was this someone else, playing court games?*

Signature of Respondent:
*Kyle L.Coker*  
*501 South West 75^th^ St. Unit A6 *  
*Gainesville, FL 32607 *

**Light Years** 

I've used hammers made out of wood  
I have played games with pieces and rules..  
I've deciphered tricks at the bar...  
But now you're gone,... I haven't figured out why...  
I've come up with riddles... and jokes about war...  
I've figured out numbers and what they're for...  
I've understood feelings.. and I've understood words...  
But how could you be taken away?...  

And wherever you've gone...and wherever we might go...  
It don't seem fair...today just disappeared...  
Your light's reflected now,... reflected from afar...  
We were but stones,... your light made us stars  

With heavy breath,... awakened regrets...  
Back pages and days alone that could have been spent,  
Together... but we were... miles apar...t  
Every inch between us becomes light years now...  
No need to be void,... or save up on life...  
You got to spend it all.....  

And wherever you've gone... and wherever we might go...  
It don't seem fair...you seemed to like it here...  
Your light's reflected now,... reflected from afar  
We were but stones,... your light made us stars  

And wherever you've gone... and wherever we might go...  
It don't seem fair...today just disappeared...  
Your light's reflected now,... reflected from afar...  
We were but stones,... your light made us stars
