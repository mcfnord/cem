## Bettina is a tool

I was warned about her. What a tool.

**Letter to Jason**

Sorry to tell you Emily had a tough night of vomiting and serious headache.  The serious headache is a new concern.
 
The Hospice number in the kitchen will take your call and a nurse can call you back. Patent is: Emily Rose Murphy, Birthday Nov 7, 1981.

Nobody goes into my office. Keep the door closed and light off.

The attendant can help do everything except choose medications. The attendant can pass medications to Emily that you provide. I have a specific list of medications and times in the kitchen.

Log all medications given on the kitchen log.

Keep Emily’s head elevated as high as she allows.
The “comfort kit“ of medications are narcotics, so they aren’t in the kitchen.
 
If she begins vomiting, get a lorazipan from the top shelf black lock box in my office. Soak it in a spoon of water for 60 seconds and turn it into a paste (or just soften it). Put this under her tongue/on her gums.
If she has a serious headache, get an oxycodone from the same lock box. Soak it in a spoon of water for 60 seconds and turn it into a paste (or just soften it). Put this under her tongue/on her gums. PREVENT headaches rather than treating them by giving her an adequate and sustained dose of oxycodone. This also PREVENTS nausea.

Guests must be approved, and must whisper.
 
Emily is not likely to have a seizure, but during a seizure, hold her and assure you won’t leave her. Afterwards, pull the oxygen machine in Chloe’s room away from the wall, turn it on, and feed it into her nose. Immediately provide 2 anti-seizure suppositories from the kitchen.

If the room gets hot, open the window completely for a while. (Remove the stick that blocks it shut.)

Basically it's never OK to mess with a kid's head like that.

**Light Years** 

I've used hammers made out of wood  
I have played games with pieces and rules..  
I've deciphered tricks at the bar...  
But now you're gone,... I haven't figured out why...  
I've come up with riddles... and jokes about war...  
I've figured out numbers and what they're for...  
I've understood feelings.. and I've understood words...  
But how could you be taken away?...  

And wherever you've gone...and wherever we might go...  
It don't seem fair...today just disappeared...  
Your light's reflected now,... reflected from afar...  
We were but stones,... your light made us stars  

With heavy breath,... awakened regrets...  
Back pages and days alone that could have been spent,  
Together... but we were... miles apar...t  
Every inch between us becomes light years now...  
No need to be void,... or save up on life...  
You got to spend it all.....  

And wherever you've gone... and wherever we might go...  
It don't seem fair...you seemed to like it here...  
Your light's reflected now,... reflected from afar  
We were but stones,... your light made us stars  

And wherever you've gone... and wherever we might go...  
It don't seem fair...today just disappeared...  
Your light's reflected now,... reflected from afar...  
We were but stones,... your light made us stars
