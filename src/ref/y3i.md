## Identifying Information and Referral:

Emily Murphy is a 32 year old Caucasian female referred to Options for a Mini-Mental State Examination to assist with the decision making 
process for custody of her 6 year old daughter.  Emily was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer and is seeking placement of her biological 
daughter.  Emily reported no significant psychological history and graduated with an associate’s degree prior to the cancer diagnosis.  The 
examination was completed at Emily’s home due to pain and physical limitations due to the brain tumors.  During the evaluation some 
accommodations in environment were made due to her high level of pain and poor motor skills in her dominant hand.

## Mini-Mental State Examination

Testing results of the MMSE show that Emily scored 24 of 30 points which suggests that Emily currently suffers mild cognitive impairment.  
However, upon further examination 4 of the 7 points missed were in the attention and calculation section which suggests that sustained 
attention and sustained complicated calculations are difficult for her.  On all other subtests she was able to complete the sections without 
difficulty missing only 3 other points.  During the writing of a sentence and drawing portion of the examination the items were difficult to 
read due to her problems with motor coordination and using the non-dominant hand.  However the sides of the figures were correct and the 
writing made a complete sentence despite being difficult to read.  Overall results suggest mild impairment in complex and sustained 
calculations.  All other portions of the examination were within normal limits suggesting only mild impairment.

**Letter to Jason**

Sorry to tell you Emily had a tough night of vomiting and serious headache.  The serious headache is a new concern.
 
The Hospice number in the kitchen will take your call and a nurse can call you back. Patent is: Emily Rose Murphy, Birthday Nov 7, 1981.

Nobody goes into my office. Keep the door closed and light off.

The attendant can help do everything except choose medications. The attendant can pass medications to Emily that you provide. I have a specific list of medications and times in the kitchen.

Log all medications given on the kitchen log.

Keep Emily’s head elevated as high as she allows.
The “comfort kit“ of medications are narcotics, so they aren’t in the kitchen.
 
If she begins vomiting, get a lorazipan from the top shelf black lock box in my office. Soak it in a spoon of water for 60 seconds and turn it into a paste (or just soften it). Put this under her tongue/on her gums.
If she has a serious headache, get an oxycodone from the same lock box. Soak it in a spoon of water for 60 seconds and turn it into a paste (or just soften it). Put this under her tongue/on her gums. PREVENT headaches rather than treating them by giving her an adequate and sustained dose of oxycodone. This also PREVENTS nausea.

Guests must be approved, and must whisper.
 
Emily is not likely to have a seizure, but during a seizure, hold her and assure you won’t leave her. Afterwards, pull the oxygen machine in Chloe’s room away from the wall, turn it on, and feed it into her nose. Immediately provide 2 anti-seizure suppositories from the kitchen.

If the room gets hot, open the window completely for a while. (Remove the stick that blocks it shut.)

IN RE: Chloe Elizabeth Murphy DOB - 27 June 2007

Grief Counseling related to the death of Emily Rose Murphy DATE: 21 July
2014

At some point something has to be said. I do not know what can come as a
result of having made this request but I do have some idea of what could
happen if it is not written.

Emily Rose Murphy, now deceased, was someone with whom I had held
multiple conversations over a period of five years. Emily was working to
become a methodical protector of the future of her daughter Chloe
Elizabeth Murphy. Emily had terminal brain cancer and died on 1 June
2014. In over a year leading to her death Emily had worked to provide
counseling and to draw a path to dealing with her death for Chloe. She
regularly and routinely visited, with John Dempsey and Chloe, grief
counseling at Bridges in Tacoma and at Gilda's Club
in Seattle where all three were members. As a part of that counseling
Chloe had been accepted into the Tacoma Camp Sparkle to be held 11-14
August 2014 from 9:30 AM to 4 PM. 

On 21 June 2014 Chloe announced that her grandmother would not allow her
to attend Camp Sparkle.

On 19 May 2014 Chloe was seized at school and placed in state custody.
When John Dempsey arrived to pick her up from school she was already in
state custody. Two days later Chloe missed her first scheduled
appointment in the grief counseling process developed by her mother and
Dempsey. The next scheduled appointments were also missed and the trips
to Gilda’s club went unattended.

On 11 July 2014 Chloe stated she did not need to nor want to eat anymore
because her mother was dead. Emily wanted the best for Chloe and spent
over a year developing the habit and expectation of regularly having
trusted adults who could talk about death and dying and grief and
acceptance. Emily had attended multiple counseling sessions and provided
a regular schedule to be followed after her death. The transition
pattern Emily established has apparently been disrupted and not without
serious consequences. I do not know when child neglect becomes abuse and
when abuse becomes criminal but I do know this is not good for Chloe
Elizabeth Murphy and I do know her mother feared her death and the
child’s current placement would have such effects on a six year old. If
this request would be better received as a complaint please feel free to
contact me.

I feel that Chloe’s attendance at Camp Sparkle could work toward giving
her the will to live that she currently says she does not have. I have
attached the enrollment records for Camp Sparkle and I strongly urge
someone with more smarts than I work to assure that Chloe gets to
attend.

**Light Years** 

I've used hammers made out of wood  
I have played games with pieces and rules..  
I've deciphered tricks at the bar...  
But now you're gone,... I haven't figured out why...  
I've come up with riddles... and jokes about war...  
I've figured out numbers and what they're for...  
I've understood feelings.. and I've understood words...  
But how could you be taken away?...  

And wherever you've gone...and wherever we might go...  
It don't seem fair...today just disappeared...  
Your light's reflected now,... reflected from afar...  
We were but stones,... your light made us stars  

With heavy breath,... awakened regrets...  
Back pages and days alone that could have been spent,  
Together... but we were... miles apar...t  
Every inch between us becomes light years now...  
No need to be void,... or save up on life...  
You got to spend it all.....  

And wherever you've gone... and wherever we might go...  
It don't seem fair...you seemed to like it here...  
Your light's reflected now,... reflected from afar  
We were but stones,... your light made us stars  

And wherever you've gone... and wherever we might go...  
It don't seem fair...today just disappeared...  
Your light's reflected now,... reflected from afar...  
We were but stones,... your light made us stars
