Tools are Imagemagick, gifsicle, ffmpeg, and Easy GIF Animator, which I bought.
Those free tools are essential, but I also need a good gui to nurse each frame along. 
It's good to test compression options on each tool to find the best compression tweaks.
  
I operate at 5kbps, so uploading gets prohibitive pretty quickly.
This pushes the necessity-invention line.

Being color, this is a fairly beefy page. 
One can change the # of colors, 
but diving straight to B&W becomes more sensible quickly, 
as muddy color adds nothing.
Never tried grayscale.

A dithered compression that works. Lots of motion blur in originals, too.

Double exposure anomaly in the original frame.

Here's some compression. My feelings are mixed about it here... but it still works, and it trims the file *enough*...

This compression works I'd say. Even a fade is expensive frame-by-frame overhead. One at the end can help the viewer reset perhaps.

This is a set of photos I piped into YouTube as a slideshow, then downloaded, then rather inartfully curated frame-by-frame. The fades between frames caused kooky anomalies.

Telling a story frame-by-frame, pushing and pulling durations until it flows.

Google Photos constructs gif animations without prompting. That's where I learned some appreciation for the genre. This is a Google Photos animation.

Ventures into Vine just because there are constraints. Compression might be helping with the vibrant colors here.

the dither compression. fuzzy, not banded.

Heavy compression, perhaps stylish banding.

Heavy manipulation of frame durations.

Heavy compression, blurs imply motion.

banding, compression anomalies.

dithered compression, fewer anomalies.

I guess this one stopped playing. Show's over.
