I'm writing about your duplex.

I've prepared this application for 
your review:

[PDF copy of application](brooklyn.pdf)

I don't write clearly so let
me explain:

I am selling my property at [2450 
Delmar Drive 
East](https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/2450-Delmar-Dr-E-Seattle-WA-98102/48770433_zpid/?fromHomePage=true), 
a property I've own for 20 years, 
and resided in for 2. I've spent 3 
months nearby at 52nd and 11th, and 
you can contact the owner of this 
apartment, named John Lindgren, 
206-234-9009, or his mom Kathy 
206-547-2505. 

Your property near 53rd and 
Brooklyn is close to transit and 
the YMCA. I visited The Ave
and found a coffee shop that looks
good.

I will have no problem paying the 
move-in costs or monthly rent. 
I take home about $4,000/mo.

I can gather more references if you 
need more. Please do send me a text 
206-384-5335 if your 
property is available.

Regards,

John Dempsey
