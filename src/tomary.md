Mary, 

This table shows options I can think of for transferring $1,025/mo.

My bank won't do direct account transfers to accounts that aren't mine.

Your bank won't take cash or a debit card transfer to your account, and won't 
sell a money order.

Money orders can be purchased from the U.S. Postal Service, but the line
there is typically long. I don't stand in lines like that one if I can 
avoid it. 

As a mitigation, I'm going to transfer $2,050 in one transaction, to
cut out one trip to the Post Office.

John
