# Embrace the chance

All these moments show life. Embrace the chance to live. Emily and I often called life a "great gift". A gift from whom? That question didn't matter to Emily. Just the wonder and joy of life, the greatness, was enough. Appreciate the chances you have to live.

**Life Pro Tip:** You don't have to feel sad when people you didn't know well die. There's no rule. There's no rule on how to feel, ever. Feelings are not rational and you are never obligated to feel the way someone says you should. Screw them! Listen to and respect your feelings. Express them to people who respect you the way you are. 

Emily emphasized **respect for yourself** as the most important lesson I must convey to you.

Remember being Student of the Month? Ms. Boglione said the award was for helping other students.

The next month, you were kinda mad that you weren't the Student of the Month again. I agree a back-to-back sweep would be impressive, and feel great. So I made you a Certificate.

That's my sister, Jeanine. She gave you that ukulele. I like how quickly you take to singing with it.
