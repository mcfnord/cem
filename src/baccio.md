Oh friends, not these tones!  
Let us raise our voices in more  
Pleasing and more joyful sounds!

Joy, beautiful spark of the gods,  
Daughter of Elysium,  
We enter fire imbibed,  
Heavenly, thy sanctuary.  

Thy magic reunites those  
Whom stern custom has parted;  
All men will become brothers  
Under thy gentle wing.  

May he who has had the fortune  
To gain a true friend  
And he who has won a noble wife  
Join in our jubilation!  

Yes, even if he calls but one soul  
His own in all the world.  
But he who has failed in this  
**Must steal away alone and in tears.**  

All the world's creatures  
Draw joy from nature's breast;  
Both the good and the evil  
Follow her rose-strewn path.  

She gave us kisses and wine  
And a friend loyal unto death;  
She gave lust for life to the lowliest,  
And the Cherub stands before God.  

Joyously, as his suns speed  
Through Heaven's glorious order,  
Hasten, Brothers, on your way,  
Exulting as a knight in victory.

Joy, beautiful spark of the gods,  
Daughter of Elysium,  
We enter fire imbibed,  
Heavenly, thy sanctuary.

Be embraced, Millions!  
This kiss for all the world!  
Brothers!, above the starry canopy  
A loving father must dwell.

Can you sense the Creator, world?  
Seek him above the starry canopy.  
Above the stars He must dwell.

Be embraced, Millions!  
This kiss for all the world!  
Brothers!, above the starry canopy  
A loving father must dwell.
