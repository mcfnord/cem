# Brain Cancer

Brain cancer is terrible.

What a change to endure with your smile intact.

In San Francisco, doctors drilled that brace into her skull a little bit. It hurt quite a bit, even with pain medicine. They wanted to hold her head very still as they shot neutrons at exactly the right places inside her brain. But they did a fresh scan, and too many new tumors had grown to perform the neutron treatment.

Emily was so sad. She wanted to yell at the doctor to do the treatment anyway. I was holding her hand. (That night at the hotel was very sad. In addition to being really scared, because the cancer was moving faster than she and the doctors could fight it, that was the night we told Darin that I was going to adopt you, which caused him to become hostile. What a rough day that was in so many ways. It was the hardest day of my life up to that point. There would be harder days to come.)

This was a few hours before very bad news. It was cold. We made keeping warm fun. We were by a cute pond between two buildings at Madigan, the hospital. We'd look for the two swans that live there.

After I took these pictures, we attended her oncology appointment, but they rushed her to the emergency room. She said she heard a terrible thing happen there: a baby arrived unconscious, and could not be revived.

She, too, was told terrible news that day. The chemotherapy was not working. We knew she had grown weaker, and dizzier, and began to wet the bed. That day, a brain scan showed more tumor growth. I held her hand as we drove home.


# See Kyle

On this page with cancer I've placed this rare photo of Kyle with you.

Emily said Kyle's a coward, and I agree. Maybe your head will be shaped like his.

Oh look, once he showed you the fishies, and that's cool.

Kyle approved of the adoption before Donna's attorney told him sick lies about me. Kyle just wants to avoid trouble. I personally think if he wanted to run away from you, he should have had the decency to respect Emily's wishes and plans for you. But that's giving him far too much credit. He was not respectful to Emily. To this day, he disrespects her wishes for you. So... I think Kyle's a punk. But he's your biological dad. Whether you want to speak to him, or not speak to him, that's really your choice. I don't think there's magic to a parent who runs away, or magic to the meaning of your life in his. Kyle skipped town and that made Em mad. He didn't even send a postcard! What a punk. Whereas me, I'm your dad, for life, as promised.
