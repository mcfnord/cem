Pizza is great. Live life, eat pizza. Notice I also brought apples, yogurt, and there's something green in that bowl!

This place is real and you are Carolee and Jerome's friend! For life! They came to many of my court hearings. They miss you.

Em said she wanted to be a flapper, which is a fancy-dressed dancer from the 1920's. We found this costume in a costume shop in Seattle, on Broadway. See the frills along the skirt? And the feather in the silver head band. I was dressed as Heck Yeah Man. (That word, *heck*, doesn't bother me! Words in general don't really bother me. Some ideas do, but not words.) And you were the classic fairy princess!

Behind us is my step-mom Pat, and my dad, Herb. I see Epona and her friend at the top. Jason has the copper mask behind me, and on the right it's Roberta and Hathan with little Mathias. He likes trains A LOT.
