my life became hell! oh, what a hell it was. but i didn't know why the hell came. i just knew something was up between Chloe's mom and me.  Two weeks ago Chloe's mom said Chloe couldn't spend the night at my house... that I'm not really family... suddenly things were more complicated. What? Chloe and I were freaked out.

WTF? I couldn't really ask... cuz her mom was getting brain cancer surgery! And then she came back from surgery and had to go straight into the hospital. So for two weeks I was wondering WTF.

So I get through to Emily in the hospital. And she says that when we were leaving for Mexico, great-grandma saw me touch Chloe inappropriately. So... the family took her to a sexual assault doctor, who said there were no signs of anything like that. (OF COURSE.) And basically they said "ok, great-grandma is kind of weird. john's also weird but did he do this?" They had 25 years of knowing me to judge with. And no, they decided nothing like that happened.

What a horrible sensation... first to know something has changed, but what? Then to know what happened behind the scenes. I was terribly frightened and now I'm just rage-filled. ;)

I wrote to grandpa (son of great-grandma) declaring my complete innocence and revulsion. But like I said he already decided this was bogus. He said it's alright so long as I'm in good with Emily, and I am. [now we see he lied.]

Now things are somewhat back to normal. I'm building a tiny bedroom in my tiny apartment where she can sleep. Don't tell me that's "risk reduction" because wtf, but it's probably appropriate and timely.

One good aspect is that it clarified my position in the larger family and with Chloe. I am considered family (about half way) despite all the differences in how our two families interpret that. Without trust for me, there's nothing left, because trust is the only reason I can live this way. Emily wants us all to go to family therapy, so I will. She's terminally ill, and I'm a dad. Our relationships extend through most of Chloe's life. It's not "traditional" and that's an issue... but it's strong and everybody knows it. Forget all the crazy crap that just went down the important part is the little child.

**after a day with Emily at her hospital bed**
  
A bit hard to explain, but basically in Mexico apparently crazy old grandma saw me flip up Chloe's dress? or flip it down? what? To see her tiny girl parts? I don't know! It's not hard to see her girl parts if that's my goal. crazy lady.

At least the sickness of this psycho sideshow is just about over. Yes, people are still seriously, perhaps fatally ill. but this whole molester bullshit is sorta over. which is not quite true... it's still Mormons. that means modesty. which is fine with me, believe it or not. yes i can explain that cartwheels in dresses that show your underwear or outta bounds. not complicated nor oppressive. dress properly for cartwheels who cares end of story.

it's clear to me that chloe loves me like krazy. and it's clear to everyone else too. which is the best part. everyone's family but I'm special to her. and she is special to me. so don't make up some psycho narrative, legions of fear. I'm happy for what i still have.

I was listening to npr today. They were talking about the new cultural shifts in Mexico and how single moms are just out there and not taboo anymore. So maybe fathers are not expected to be so into their kids and maybe the grandparents were freaked out that you paid attention to her and their minds made up bull. It sucked and I am sorry for you. Crazy people.

Thank you for being awesome to that girl!!!

*When Chloe was 5, I wrote a short vignette of Mariela being Chloe's mom. Chloe took great interest in what I wrote, and sounded surprised and deeply touched that so many words had been written for her. "I'm so happy you wrote all this for me!" It was probably 50 words. The next night she asked to read it to us by candle light.*

For Father's Day I gave Chloe the longest hug in the world, maybe 5 minutes, because she wouldn't let go. It's clear the problems are taking a toll on her. We won't let her fall apart.﻿

Went to "pre-bereavement therapy" I guess you might call it. For the second time. This time was better than last time. Therapists are good at making ya feel special, and getting you to trust them and tell them stuff. I thought of two more manifestations of resilience. Last month we just talked about joy and hope, reasons to carry on, but today I added bravery and flexibility. Bend or break. My whole situation does boil down to bend or break. The therapists said maybe i can join Emily's group, rather than feeling awkward with her parents. But the Apocalypse is Emily's exit followed by strained relations with them which gives me the Double Whammy loss festival. I guess I'll explain that next time. The glorious Double Whammy. The therapist said my situation is complex. She said complex like 5 times about it. I am not suffering like many suffer. I was curiously upbeat, cuz I realized if I'm not feeling sad I don't have to act all sad. Partly I'm not focused on feeling sad because I always knew this day was likely. Think about it: I met Emily after her second surgery... you can look at actuarial tables or you can live your life. So I just accepted. And so in therapy I want to focus on those who live (the child) but the parents see their child (the momma) who is likely to die. Which I agree is a particularly horrible sensation. 

I have made it this far being recklessly resilient. Hell, December crazy grandma pegged me for a child fucker of some kind, and nobody told me, but everyone was freaked out and I didn't know why. That's how the year started. To be where I am now is remarkable. I will articulate that even if my future in Chloe's life is nothing like my past, it will be worth it, the world burns, people go crazy, people die, people get separated, it's not my choice. Chloe's outrageous attachment to me has made it all ok. I know the world blows things up all the time, and children get locked in basements instead of freed, cuz the world's cold, cuz life's hard, cuz misery loves company. I can't control when Chloe becomes someone else's child. Emily designated her parents and her parents will designate whatever they want. If that destroys a huge part of my life, I'll be like the Joker walking away as the building explodes. I guess I can write letters. And all this is contrived worst-case thinking. Still, fuck this child fucker shit, still hanging over me long after everyone else forgot, plus fuck anyone who doesn't jump in and interact with a child, just clucking the rights and the wrongs. When I explain things to Chloe, she has always showed the greatest appreciation. She hears Rights and Wrongs all day long but how often are things explained?

Well everything's secret there so I can't tell you more. It's just a group of volunteers who lived through loss and people doing so now. I figure fuck it, everyone's still alive, let's go have some fun. And if ya die, at least we had some fun. Don't overthink death around those who still live.﻿

Emily was interviewed by Jeris Underwood, who is one of two Jerises in Pierce County. My mother is the other, of course.
