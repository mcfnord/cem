## Three writing samples

I've chosen these three examples of my work. See more by visiting [my online 
resume'](http://tucc.us/resume).


### One

- **SAMPLE:** [Get started with Azure Blob storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/storage-dotnet-how-to-use-blobs) 
- **MY ROLE:** This was a collaborative effort with two non-writers. They knew what areas 
they wished to cover, what audience they had in mind, and how much time the tutorial 
would take. I tailored the code snippets, steps, and details to be clear and helpful. I 
prevented publication of errors, and actually I remember actual fighting-like-dogs events 
around this document, because it was the brainchild of an unusually revered Microsoft cat 
who is now credited with making Azure relevant. I am really embarassed that the diagram 
is a .jpg. I used .png in a related example, which looks much better. People deserve 
better than .jpg for diagrams. I'll also say there's new writing in some of this that 
wasn't in my original. 
- **EDITED MYSELF?:** I may have informally involved my 
officemate, who also edits, but officially I played the writer and editor roles in this 
project.

### Two

- **SAMPLE:** [Human Interface Guide](http://tucc.us/docs/hig.pdf)
- **MY ROLE:** Constructed publication from diverse source materials and interviews.
- **EDITED MYSELF?:** 100%

### Three

- **SAMPLE:** [Engineering Roadmap](http://tucc.us/docs/roadmap_blur.png) 
- **MY ROLE:** 
(This is blurry by request.)
Worked with 
technical staff to plan engineering roadmap. 
This marketing information features the assets of a ten million dollar company during its solvent 
bankruptcy. 
- **EDITED MYSELF?:** Yeah.

### Bonus sample!

- **SAMPLE:** [Walkthrough: Manually Deploying a ClickOnce 
Application](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/xc3tc5xx%28VS.100%29.aspx) 
- **MY ROLE:** (I felt bad about showing you that blurry sample.) This is 100% my work. I'm 
including it because it's a very tricky topic. Nobody could use it. Then I wrote this and 
people were more successful with this technology. It's still a very tricky technology to 
use. I wrote this by using the heck out of the Mage.exe tool. 
- **EDITED MYSELF?:** I had the help of a very skilled editor on this.


## Answeraire in response to Questionaire

I've written for SaaS and Web applications. One system in 
particular gave non-technical users a powerful platform for 
learning marketing costs of their inbound call enterprises, 
recording calls securely, routing calls based on the area 
code of the caller, and other clever, useful stuff. The 
browser-based UI for this tool was garbage. A team answered 
calls all day about the browser app's snafus and quirks. I 
was given very broad authority to upgrade the app's 
documentation. I designed a Markdown-based platform that let 
me publish easily to both PDF and a browse-able hierarchy of 
HTML. I made sure my design let anyone get a URL to a 
specific page and section in the content. The final 
publication might have been 300 pages, including newbie 
walkthroughs, nitty-gritty details, magic tricks, and 
developer APIs. I voraciously studied app features and 
failings, using bug reports, historical design docs, source 
code, and logs of incoming email support incidents. When I 
was done, the team taking customer calls could send back a 
URL! They didn't have to hold the caller's hand, because my 
docs did that. And that customer, with a browseable 
hierarchy and PDF, might never need to call back. I couldn't 
fix the horrible UI. Instead, I used publishing tools and 
investigation to bridge the gap between what the user wants 
and how this kooky UI can do it.

Perhaps Web-based software can be more opaque than 
traditional software. If I know only that my user has a 
browser on the internet, then I can reach them there! Since 
I'm not shipping content, but only links to content, I can 
push more to readers, get feedback more often, and fix 
errors in a snap.  Web-based software does have some 
advantages for writers and publishers.

That telephone software had many CRM features. Businesses 
want to know who calls, and who calls once vs. twenty times. 
Some flavors of the tracking technology determined 
first-time caller demographics as the call rings, or told 
you exactly which search terms preceded the call. Tricky! 
Clever! Valuable!

My typical process favors a finished product. ;) I've 
ingested (*burp*) specs, requirements, and prototypes by the 
tens of thousands of pages. I read them all with a 
highlighter. But those are mere suggestions of what the user 
might get some day. Sounds like fodder for a skeleton 
outline, but what good is that? I want to talk about what 
works. Where can I get the daily dev build, and log of 
check-ins and diffs? How can I add documentation-specific 
flags to bugs? How can I log bullet points of what I want to 
confirm in the finished product? Specs, requirements, and 
prototypes are vaporware. While I'm often working with these 
clues to build out a skeleton of user-specific or 
developer-oriented task lists, I write about apps that run. 
Those pre-product sources suggest explanations of features, 
special cases, and caveats that might help a user use the 
software. I'll pass along everything written in these 
documents that could possibly help the user succeed. Reading 
and repeating are large parts of the job.

At a company called Qpass (now Amdocs) I single-sourced 
using AuthorIT, a professional publishing package. A more 
unusual instance where I single-sourced involves Microsoft's 
Azure cloud platform. I worked in a small group to rewrite 
all the emails Azure sends to users about critical account 
events. This task was unique because the tool that emailed 
users was a Microsoft-wide tool, serving huge audiences with 
important billing, access, and other event details. Many of 
the paragraphs about credit cards and access control were 
used by multiple organizations and products! We had to 
modify the text enough to help our customers, without 
throwing other customers into confusion about, say, their 
Office subscription. We ended up mixing the shared 
paragraphs with some custom paragraphs of our own. I still 
remember this when I get these emails from Azure. And it's a 
good critique of single-sourcing: Trying to reach diverse 
audiences with chunks of tagged content can be a pain, 
especially when audiences differ significantly.

I was hired as part of a turnaround team to save a company 
from collapse. There were about 200 employees. The company 
collected price data without getting noticed. The staff 
included hackers whose code was poor and opaque. As I 
documented their systems, 23 were laid off. I reviewed all 
returned company computers for critical information, and 
found some. The whole turnaround involved centralizing and 
surfacing every function of the enterprise. Eventually I 
filled a wall with maps of the stealth network, databases, 
scripts, and code repositories that drove the enterprise. 
Engineers scrutinized my wall of systems and plans. 
Prospective buyers examined assets using large prints I 
prepared of the data flows and other assets. I video taped 
some technical talks and dramatically compressed them so the 
India teams could watch. I solicited tribal knowledge from 
the India teams, and translated very dense reports rich with 
vernacular into easy guidance. At one point the leadership 
worked with staff to evaluate the hiring priorities and 
needs. I asked them to use Post-its to add career details 
and hiring criteria for people we associated with company 
expansion tasks. I integrated meeting feedback into a clear 
hiring plan. I got to make timlines of product improvements, 
color-coded and easy to follow.

The company was saved, and my documentation skills, which I 
got to apply in a myriad of ways, played a pivotal role in 
the re-engineering and acquisition processes.

I documented the REST-level API of the Windows Azure storage 
system. I learned about it from existing documentation, plus 
clues about features that hadn't been documented yet. 
External and internal blogs offered some clues. I learned 
about these features by using them. Sometimes that meant 
using an app like Fiddler, or using a framework like the 
.NET SDK for Azure storage, and tracking the HTTPS traffic 
using Fiddler again. Other times I had to know where Azure 
logs some events. When something just didn't make sense, I 
had experts I could ask.

I remember feeling really frustrated with a new Azure 
storage feature, a simple file-to-cloud API. I had the 
newest SDK, but my file never fully wrote to the cloud. Some 
small ones did, but larger ones didn't. The experts said I'd 
get an exception if it failed. They asked if I was ignoring 
exceptions from their code. I simplified my repro case, by 
switching to public storage buckets, and making a simple 
command line report of how many bytes were transferred. I 
put the .EXE on a server and went home. In the morning, I 
learned I wasn't failing, the .NET layer was. The dev 
released a blog explanation at 11pm, and new release of SDK 
bits the next day. With the feature finally working, I could 
write about it down to its nuances, by triggering all the 
features the interface claimed to provide. Here's what I 
wrote next:

## TECHNOLOGIES AND ME

Let's dive in!

### XML authoring tools like Oxygen or Arbortext Editor

  - **Used daily?:** No.
  - **Self-rating:** 6
  - **Comments:** I don't use this stuff daily, but still 
rate myself competently, because I speak XML, and because 
I've worked closely with DocStudio, the XML-based content 
management behind MSDN. I've also used AuthorIT, which tags 
chunks.  I've done a lot of non-documentation XML, and a lot 
of documentation. At Microsoft I've done XML-based 
documentation on MSDN many times.

### Image editing/creation software

  - **Used daily?:** Yes.
  - **Self-rating:** 7
  - **Comments:** Let's get something straight: I can create 
a miserable image using the coolest software. I can also 
provide great images using rather average tools. In this 
example, I used Visio:

I also create animated gifs as a hobby:

And I use ffmpeg. So. I'm kind of a big deal.
  
### HTML

  - **Used daily?:** Yes.
  - **Self-rating:** 8
  - **Comments:** Yeah, I use HTML daily. I learned HTML 
before there was CSS. Now HTML can include JavaScript 
libraries that navigate the DOM and round-trips 
asynchronously with servers. How much HTML trouble is 
actually HTML? Usually it's browser differences, plug-in 
quirks, or some other non-HTML cause. I use PHP to write 
tricks in HTML to run projects on multiple domains.

### Source control software

  - **Used daily?:** Yes.
  - **Self-rating:** 7
  - **Comments:** I use git and GitHub daily. I've made 
branches, pushed and pulled with it. [John's GitHub](https://github.com/mcfnord/)

I like writing, getting the scoop, and delivering the news. In this case the 
news might be the full description of what a user must know and do to make your offering 
valuable to them. A technical writer is the user's last line of defense. Maybe the UI is 
only halfway to where we want it. Telling the user now what they can do now is fun for 
me. Showing everyone what it *really* takes to use a software product can help drive the 
designs for improvements. I like how writing can clarify just how successful we are at 
simplifying user tasks. 
Writing can separate the substance from the vapors, let the chips fall where they may. 

I wrote this on [my own publication 
platform](https://github.com/mcfnord/cem/blob/master/pub.sh). Here's [the Markdown source
