# See John

![](img/file0018.jpg)

My hair seems to be sideways. A falling bang and rising smirk.  

# See Emily

Your eyes, each day's different hair, such glamour, even in a hospital gown, 
seeing humor, showing affection, dressed wild, or [to the 
nines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_the_nines).

![](img/tonguebus.jpg)

Chloe, you were her top priority. She endured much for you, happily. You made 
her smile. She noticed you're a cool person early on. She said, "Everyone says 
their kid is cool, but mine really is. I really feel lucky to know her." I feel 
the same way.

![](img/mom_mirror.gif)


Emily laughed so much.  It's hard to find a picture where she isn't smiling. 
She joked around a lot, too. She and I shared a wild and goofy sense of humor.

# See Marines

She loved the Marines. She said it was where she saw the world as it is, the 
real world. What world did she see before she joined the Marines at the 
unusually young age of 17?

![](img/stand_em.gif)

Emily said Marines always carry a pencil and paper. What do you think of that 
idea?

![](img/runnin.jpg)

Em was shy when she was young. As a Marine on Okinawa, she got much bolder. 
Okinawa was full of Marines, mostly young men. She developed socially and 
professionally in the Marines. She learned to love sushi in Okinawa, which is an island in Japan.

# See Before Lion's Gate

Remember the park up the alley from my first house? *Ally in the alley.* 

![](img/hideblanket.gif)

Chloe and Emily hide under the covers. I loved having a couch outside like 
that. So cozy when they weather's cool, just add some sun and feel fine.

![](img/dscn4426.jpg)

We could color on the walls in the two clubhouses. You called the big one "the 
book club" after that reading character, remember him?

I remember once I told you that house was torn down. It is gone now. You were 
sad it was gone, with all our memories there. But I moved on to Lion's Gate, 
where you met Coco and Kirara.

### Parks 

![](img/dscn3777.jpg)

Cynthia was your first friend out of the house. Once her mom invited us in. 
They lived next to this park, in the alley. Remember that gorilla pushing that 
frame sideways? You climbed up the back many times. We'd run in that field 
beyond.

When you and Emily came into my life, and would get me out to the park each 
Saturday and Sunday, I learned to have fun in parks again. They are great 
places. We went to many, as you may remember.

Once, when you were 2, we left a park. I rode you incredibly slowly on my 
bicycle to home. Emily just jogged along with us. I was able to "grab" you with 
my legs, so it was pretty safe, but at one point you seemed to... go... limp! 
You had fallen asleep on the bike after a long day at the park.

I sure loved all the parks we've visited, and all the fun we had, even making 
friends in the neighborhood. That was where you took your first ride down the 
slide, and first trip across the monkey bars. Em and I loved parks. (We loved 
coffeehouses with sandwiches and soup and a leather couch the most.) Around the 
outside of that park were stone pillars along the fence where you could climb. 
The cement on the pillars had toys and pictures glued in. Something to climb 
on. We spent so much time in the park.

# See Cruel Brain Cancer

Brain cancer is terrible.

![](img/operate.gif)

What a change to endure with your smile intact.

![](img/cut_skull2.gif)

![](img/057.jpg)

In San Francisco, doctors drilled that brace into her skull a little bit. It hurt quite a bit, even with pain medicine. They wanted to hold her head very still as they shot neutrons at exactly the right places inside her brain. But they did a fresh scan, and too many new tumors had grown to perform the neutron treatment.

Emily was so sad. She wanted to yell at the doctor to do the treatment anyway. I was holding her hand. (That night at the hotel was very sad. In addition to being really scared, because the cancer was moving faster than she and the doctors could fight it, that was the night we told Darin that I was going to adopt you, which caused him to become hostile. What a rough day that was in so many ways. It was the hardest day of my life up to that point. There would be harder days to come.)

![](img/pond.gif)

This was a few hours before very bad news. It was cold. We made keeping warm fun. We were by a cute pond between two buildings at Madigan, the hospital. We'd look for the two swans that live there.

After I took these pictures, we attended her oncology appointment, but they rushed her to the emergency room. She said she heard a terrible thing happen there: a baby arrived unconscious, and could not be revived.

She, too, was told terrible news that day. The chemotherapy was not working. We knew she had grown weaker, and dizzier, and began to wet the bed. That day, a brain scan showed more tumor growth. I held her hand as we drove home.


# See Kyle

On this page with cancer I've placed this rare photo of Kyle with you. 

![](img/dsc00516.jpg)

Emily said Kyle's a coward, and I agree. Maybe your head will be shaped like his.

![](img/dsc00514.jpg)

Oh look, once he showed you the fishies, and that's cool.

Kyle approved of the adoption before Donna's attorney told him sick lies about me. Kyle just wants to avoid trouble. I personally think if he wanted to run away from you, he should have had the decency to respect Emily's wishes and plans for you. But that's giving him far too much credit. He was not respectful to Emily. To this day, he disrespects her wishes for you. So... I think Kyle's a punk. But he's your biological dad. Whether you want to speak to him, or not speak to him, that's really your choice. I don't think there's magic to a parent who runs away, or magic to the meaning of your life in his. Kyle skipped town and that made Em mad. He didn't even send a postcard! What a punk. Whereas me, I'm your dad, for life, as promised.
 
# See Life

Emily told me many times, and asked if I agreed, that life is a great gift. It is. No bill is due--it is a gift--but what other word can describe it? Joy often requires adversity and sorrow. 

She did not want to die. She would get mad at cancer, want to punch it, for taking her away from you. I agree again. I was with her at the moments she got the worst news. She absolutely hated dying, because she could not watch you grow. 

![](img/she_thumb.gif)

Emily approved of you making up your own mind. We talked about it a lot. Don't fall for all the "weak tea" in the world. She approved of you singing, dancing, expressing yourself, and being quiet or private. She told me  **respecting yourself** is the most important thing you need to do. She said each time she had not followed her gut instinct, she regretted it later. It was her gut instinct that brought me to Tacoma. She told me to tell you: Respect your gut instinct. Respect your body and your feelings. That means listening when they give you clues, and respecting your wisdom. To stand a chance at happiness, you must choose your own life. You'll be unhappy with the life others would happily choose for you.

Once Fatima came to the apartment where we all lived, by Wright Park. She really liked the place. She wondered, "How can I get a place like this?" Emily said, "First, join the Marines. Serve eight years. Then get brain cancer, and get medically retired. Easy!"

![](img/sexyem.jpg)

Style down to the shoes! 

# See Music is a big deal

![](img/stunnin.jpg)

Her dress! Her style.

Em enjoyed Ke$ha's openness, and willingness to express herself. We all sang her song *Tik Tok*. A life involving alcohol in partying is risky, unwise behavior, as is clowning around in a moving car with no seat belt on, but it's just a music video. 

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iP6XpLQM2Cs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This is Ke$ha's first big hit. You sang its words. I think it was the first pop song you learned. Em liked Ke$ha's lyrics, dancing, and her attitude of playful mischief and frank openness about her feelings. Em also liked this other song by Ke$ha:

### Singing songs and poems

Em loved songs I had never heard of. She was 12 years younger than me, and listened to much more hip-hop, but she also just loved lyrics and words. We loved singing together. 

There came a time in the last 6 months of her life when she and I both sang our feelings. She said it was easier than talking about them. I agree.

Emily also loved words. She loved funny words, unusual words. This is a video we both laughed at when we first met in Mexico: *Bulbous Bouffant*

# See Wonderment

I remember when Em and I took you to an exciting movie, called *Scott Pilgrim vs. the World*. You were 4. The show had 3D glasses. You were so stunned to see the people transform into super-heroes, and back. Your jaw dropped open in awe. It made us laugh. :) 

![](img/fashionkiss.gif)

Yes, you.

![](img/figuree.jpg)

Oh momma.

# Striving
 
![](img/gra2.jpg)

![](img/gra1.jpg)


Here's one thing to get straight about your mother: She graduated and graduated some more. Education is the pathway to independence.

![](img/sushdood.jpg)

I think she told me this was a Marine friend of hers.

# See There you are

![](img/02.jpg)

This is from Melissa's wedding. I remember attending. I saw Emily there after many years 
of not seeing her. I saw her tattoo and asked who Chloe is. You were at that wedding, but 
I didn't meet you there. We didn't meet until 
[you and Emily joined me in Mexico](y1xS3.html), a week 
later. You grabbed onto my head and said, "There you are!"

![](img/bright_eyes.jpg)

Emily kept this photo on her phone for a long time.

![](img/tentz.jpg)

We loved camping. Twice we went to the Metow River to raft there. I brought my hammock. You got to roam around the forest campout area. (I kept an eye on you every second, because the river could really sweep a child away!) Em went rafting in a wetsuit. It's a wild river. 

![](img/ssn.jpg)

# See Memories

This is a famous painting called *The Starry Night*, by Vincent van Gogh. We're at the Museum of Modern Art, in Manhattan. They wouldn't let kids ride on shoulders so we had to carry you through the whole museum. But that was fine.

![](img/blow.jpg)

Emily's birthday. I guess that's her last birthday. That's at Aunt Melissa's house. I think she took the picture.

![](img/nutkiss.jpg)

My family took you both to the Nutcracker while I moved my things to Tacoma. Donna made a fuss because she preferred you attend church that day. I'm glad Emily came to the performance. Perhaps some people value exceptional seasonal dance musical theater, and some people believe regular church attendance is more valuable. There are many kinds of people in the world.

![](img/nutzz.jpg)

Freda Everdell, who is Paula's mom, who was always there on 4th of July when we camped in Longbeach, knew what Emily wanted for you, and she stood with Emily. Paula is next to you and Emily in this picture.

# See Gimme some sugar!

![](img/kissyme.gif)

When she wanted a kiss, she'd say, "Gimme some sugar!"

![](img/gooff.gif)

She was a very funny person! Total goofball.

![](img/newuke.gif)

My sister Jeanine and your new ukulele. 

# See Seattle

![](img/chloebiker.jpg)

From the moment you saw my bicycle you wanted to ride. This was the first day you joined me on the bike. If you ever put a baby on a bicycle, get them a helmet first. Shoes are also required on a bicycle! But we went super-slow and didn't lose any toes. We got you a helmet and boots. Do you remember those rides we took into the empty parking garage? I loved the few real rides we took together, where you got to feel the rush of a ride on a bicycle. I still ride my bicycle! Be safe and smart on your bicycle, and it can be a tool of freedom. 

## The Lion's Gate Apartment

Coco, Kirara, and many others.

On a warm evening in Seattle, we left with Harry and probably Kirara to the park, where we watched *PeeWee's Big Adventure*. We did this twice, actually, on two different years. That was the same park where Coco and her little brother got in the water fountain with us. We used to play at that kid's play area, Em and I would sit at the bench and eat, or play hide-and-seek with you.

The hospital where I got my allergy injections had a big slide behind it.

I remember when we visited Seattle, and ate sushi. Em and me took you there when you were younger, too. It's my favorite sushi in Seattle. It's called HaNa, which means *beautiful flower* in Japanese.

# Harry
 
![](img/harry_cut.gif)

Harry gave you your first haircut.  

![](img/yellin.gif)

He's always fun.

# See In Memorium

![](img/surfin.gif)

Warm in this sun, sand, and surf. This is in California.

![](img/beachy.gif)

Madison Park in Seattle.

![](img/pizzaza.gif)

Pizza is great. Live life, eat pizza. Notice I also brought apples, yogurt, and there's something green in that bowl!

![](img/cemtat.jpg)

# See Rusty Cock Ridge

![](img/puzzle.gif)

This place is real and you are Carolee and Jerome's friend! For life! They came to many of my court hearings. They miss you.

![](img/rcridge1.gif)

Let's all go to RCRidge to see Carolee and Jerome! Always a cozy adventure! Let's go there.

![](img/sewin.gif)

Maybe she'll have her sewing machine out.

That looked fun. Surfing around the yard!

![](img/22rcr.jpg)

There's Carolee's phone number! There's her email. And here's mine: 

![](http://tucc.us/img/addr.png)

Em said she wanted to be a flapper, which is a fancy-dressed dancer from the 1920's. We found this costume in a costume shop in Seattle, on Broadway. See the frills along the skirt? And the feather in the silver head band. I was dressed as Heck Yeah Man. (That word, *heck*, doesn't bother me! Words in general don't really bother me. Some ideas do, but not words.) And you were the classic fairy princess!

Behind us is my step-mom Pat, and my dad, Herb. I see Epona and her friend at the top. Jason has the copper mask behind me, and on the right it's Roberta and Hathan with little Mathias. He likes trains A LOT. 

# See Embrace the chance 

![](img/dook.gif)

All these moments show life. Embrace the chance to live. Emily and I often called life a "great gift". A gift from whom? That question didn't matter to Emily. Just the wonder and joy of life, the greatness, was enough. Appreciate the chances you have to live.

**Life Pro Tip:** You don't have to feel sad when people you didn't know well die. There's no rule. There's no rule on how to feel, ever. Feelings are not rational and you are never obligated to feel the way someone says you should. Screw them! Listen to and respect your feelings. Express them to people who respect you the way you are. 

Emily emphasized **respect for yourself** as the most important lesson I must convey to you. 

![](img/kookd.gif)

I promised her. 

![](img/spring.gif)

Remember this spring day soggy with Epona?

![](img/flowrs.gif)

Remember being Student of the Month? Ms. Boglione said the award was for helping other students.

![](img/stumo.jpg)

The next month, you were kinda mad that you weren't the Student of the Month again. I agree a back-to-back sweep would be impressive, and feel great. So I made you a Certificate. 

# See Yes

![](img/badm.gif)

Do you see the quirk? You clone yourself!? That's my older brother, Jim.

![](img/ch4.jpg)

My mom Jeris, Grandma Jeris, at your 4th birthday in Jefferson Park.

![](img/glos.jpg)

The restaurant was Glo's. The toy was pipe cleaners.

![](img/top_esb.jpg)

Top of the Empire State Building.

![](img/rockin.gif)

That's my sister, Jeanine. She gave you that ukulele. I like how quickly you take to singing with it.
