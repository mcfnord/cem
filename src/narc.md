To summarize, things to look for:

* Your intuition warns you something weird is happening
* Inflexible black and white thinking
* Empathy challenged
* Nor respecting boundaries
* Oddly or overly critical

If there is a conversation that would frustrate even the calmest of us all, it is one with a High Level Narcissist.

There are basically three things to remember when you have a conversation with them.

One. They must win.

Whether it be a discussion, casual conversation, an important exchange of feelings, thoughts, opinions, it doesn’t matter. The intelligent 
Narcissist has an arsenal of phrases and words to put just about anybody on the defensive. Conversations with Narcissists are NOT a mutual 
exchange. They are playing a game and a confusing one at that. This is often referred to as “Word Salad”.

Two. They must extract your confidence.

By putting you in a one-down position for having an opinion, a boundary, a thought, a suggestion or heaven forbid a need, the Narcissist 
will find a vulnerability to bring you down a notch or two. By lowering your confidence and gaining the upper-hand, most neurotypicals 
will be “thrown off guard” in the moment. In the moment while you are left feeling confused, gaslighted, and spoken to in sometimes a 
condescending way, the Narcissist goes back to Number One. They feel powerful and above-you.

That leads us to number three.

They must come off as making you feel and look defective in some way, shape or form. They will often project their own lack of confidence 
or weakness onto you. If you carry it, they don’t have to.

So, there you have it. Though there are other more insidious tactics a Narcissist may use (especially a Psychopath who derives pleasure 
from making you feel small or duped), these are the basics to remember. The Narcissist often incorporates theses strategies as protection 
from shame and vulnerability and to gain power and control of the conversation. They may sometimes disguise the response or communication 
as a sarcastic “joke” leaving you to question were you just put down or not?

Remember: Keep these three strategies in mind if you are going to engage in a conversation with a Narcissist and say less and listen more. 
Understanding is the key to healing and protection.


If you are close to someone with Narcissistic Personality Disorder, you are likely to eventually notice that they appear to have some very 
specific memory problems:

Example 1: When they do something bad, they quickly forget it. If you insist on bringing it to their attention and even offer proof that 
it occurred, they will still deny it and become angry at you.

Example 2: If you do something that they do not like, they will suddenly get mad at you and act as if they have forgotten all the good 
things that you have done for them in the past.

What is happening?

Narcissists do not have “whole object relations.” This means that they cannot see themselves and other people as a mixture of good and 
bad, liked and disliked traits. They can only see people as all-good or all-bad.

All-Good = Special, Perfect, Omnipotent, Successful, and Always Right

All-Bad = Worthless, Defective, Garbage, Failure, and Always Wrong

Of course neither of these views are at all realistic. Because the good and bad views are not reconciled and integrated into a coherent 
whole, they each give birth to two separate and opposite histories.

History 1—All-Good

When Narcissists’ grandiose defenses protect them from seeing anything negative about themselves or their behavior, they experience 
themselves as always having been as perfect, special, and all-good as they feel in the present. Only the details that support this 
distorted view are seen and acknowledged by them. Anything that contradicts this view is ignored and becomes part of the unseen 
background.





Confronting a narcissist is actually one of the most definitive ways to illustrate narcissism. Assuming, of course, 
that you are their primary source of supply of attention and validation.

A narcissist NEEDS you to believe in the false persona he has created. Depending on the type of narcissist, it can be 
this popular, charming, successful, dynamic, admirable hero or the quiet, self effacing, sacrificing, helpful, 
supportive, calm helpmate. His emotional well being is completely dependent on the validation you provide to him that 
he isn’t some useless, shameful failure. Narcissism is fundamentally a shame based personality disorder. He is 
petrified that people (specially you) will discover he isn’t what he wants you to think.

So any indication that you have uncovered his true nature is like taking the inhaler away from an asthmatic patient. 
There is a catastrophic response because you cannot be allowed to uncover any sign of failure. If he can’t cajole, 
beg, plead, overwhelm, love bomb you into believing in the lie again, he will switch to gas lighting you, making you 
doubt your own perception, subtly making you feel like it’s your fault.

If that doesn’t work, he may switch to creating a crisis, a distraction of sorts.

Or he may get aggressive in an attempt to bully you back into following his instructions. This can get very 
intimidating as sometimes the target may not even KNOW they are in a fight. It may be something minor and unimportant 
for them.

If that fails, if a narcissist feels you cannot be brought back in line, he will discredit and isolate you. You will 
suddenly find yourself in the midst of a nasty gossip campaign, your family and friends will hear absolutely horrible 
things about you.

As someone who wasn’t familiar with narcissism, it took time for me to identify the various tactics that were used on 
me. But the cycle is interesting to watch, once you have stepped away from damage.

Narcissists commonly have a toxic but stable dynamic with their family of origin. This is the environment that caused their disorder. The rules and hierarchies are all established and in place and it can be very 
stable. Narcisissts don’t typically “destroy” their family of origin if they haven’t already done so. Their family of origin is what destroyed them.

As far as spouses and children (and in-laws)… these are new people that now have to fit into the established, toxic dynamic. If they want something better, like respect, autonomy, fairness or consideration, then 
they will need to look elsewhere. Or they can cooperate with the narrative and be emotionally destroyed with the rest of the toxic borg.

I got off on a little bit of a tangent. Narcissists destroy their families because they are pathologically self centered. If the family doesn’t revolve around them, it must be disbanded and destroyed. There is no 
room in the narcissist’s world for reciprocity, cooperation or consideration of others. Families typically need those things in order to stay together (unless they establish a stable, toxic dynamic).	

The easiest way to understand Narcissism is to imagine that you are a car with a leaky gas tank. The fuel you run on is self-esteem. Even if you start the day with a full tank, you can feel your self-esteem start 
to diminish as you go through the day.

You have learned to stay focused on potential sources of new fuel—praise, chances to outdo someone else, proximity to high status people and things—and things that deplete your self-esteem—criticism, being 
ignored, devalued, or disgarded.

Self-Hating Depression
If you run out of fuel, you not only stop moving forward, you start to sink into a pit of deep emotional mud. The deeper you sink, the worse you feel about yourself. At the very bottom you become immobilized by 
your shame and self-hatred. This makes you very motivated to keep finding new sources of fuel.

The Other Cars
The way you see it, every other car on the road is competing with you for fuel. You are so preoccupied with your own needs that you could not care less about their situation.

The only other cars that interest you are potential sources of more fuel for you, like the gorgeous expensive vehicles who seem to have their own inner gas stations that give them the continuous supply of 
self-esteem that you lack. You hope that, if you play your cards right, they will let you use their source to refuel.

Hypersensitivity and No Emotional Empathy
You are also on the lookout for fuel thieves. You are hyper vigilant and ready to defend your self-esteem against anything you know lessens your supply—competitors, anyone who ignores you, criticizes you, or 
disagrees with you. You not only do not care about their problems, everytime you devalue them you can feel a surge of new fuel enter you.

Punchline: The term “Narcissism” is short for the pattern of thinking and behavior that is called “Narcissistic Personality Disorder” or NPD. In its simplest form it can be described as an ongoing problem with 
self-esteem regulation coupled with a lack of emotional empathy. Or in my terms: The self-centered, desperate and ongoing search for emotional fuel in the form of self esteem.

Actually they do, generally just before they start going into narcissistic collapse. Because the truth well, they can't handle the truth. They got two plays in their playbook, one is going around acting all 
perfect and two is collapsing into their core personality of self loathing and hating.

They view themselves as perfect to stay as far away from their self hating true self as they can. They cannot think in a incremental way. They cannot be part bad and mostly good or visa versa. It is one or the 
other, period. They look inside, being human there will be flaws and bam!, they are all bad, and the self hating self loathing beings.

Most all victims. Are codependents. Sensitives. People pleasers. Echoists. Have low self esteem. Most have a desire to be needed, wanted, 
want to think they can help or save someone. Most are hopeless romantics that are loyal to a fault. That believe in the happily ever after 
as long you put in enough effort. But we also overlook all the bad, believing what they are seeing, is an illusion. They lie to 
themselves.

Because victims will NEVER win against a narcissist if the victim tries to refute or explain anything the narcissist does (or did) against 
them. What will happen is the narcissist (remember narcissists are expert manipulators) will come out looking like the victim and the true 
victim will come out looking like the abuser and the crazy one.

I hear this a lot. I really don't think it's taking the high road. It's just self-preservation. Like the authors of many of this questions 
answers say. It's more about understanding that you can't win going head-to-head with a narcissist. You will not change them.

They have spent their entire lives creating this facade of who they are. This is everything to them. They will do everything and anything 
to protect the lie that they have carefully cultivated. They have been smear campaigning you from the very first day they met you. You 
were always going to be discarded. You were always replaceable. You can't compete with that. They know what they're doing. They know right 
from wrong. They just don't care.

Someone very close to me loves using the term that “I keep projecting normal into him.” This is a very true statement and it makes me 
laugh every time because it's a constant reminder that you keep looking at things through your eyes.

You have morals. You have empathy. You care if you hurt somebody. You have a set of guidelines and moral codes that you follow in your 
interactions with people. Narcissist don't. In other words, you have empathy. Their only existence is for themselves. Everything they do 
is a manipulation to serve a self-interest. They do not do things for others unless it serves an interest of their own. It was never about 
you. You weren't special to them. You were just there. You mean as much to them as a headlight on a car. That is why they can replace you 
so easily. Every time they make a decision it is based on what they need, what they want , and how it'll affect them. You and I are not 
able to think like that. And that is why you “keep projecting normal onto them.”

When the narcissist was a neglected infant not getting their most basic needs met, their brain had to develop coping mechanisms to 
survive. One mechanism they developed was the tool of manipulation. We all have it to a degree but with a narcissist it is severely 
hightened. They are masters of manipulation. They use these manipulation tools to get what they want. Due to the severity of the neglect 
(Reactive Attachment Disorder), they also never developed a sense of self. So they learned to mirror others. Which consisted of them 
studying others to learn how to act. Narcissists are similar to say a blind person or a deaf person. Those people lost one of their senses 
and they develop extra skills in their other senses to make up for the loss. The narcissist lost a lot of their attachment feelings before 
they ever had them. Because they didn’t bond with a primary caregiver during the formative time frame they can never have many of the 
feelings we all take for granted, like love, empathy, sympathy, regret, remorse. With no true sense of self and no ability to have the 
full range of emotions they had to study people a lot to figure out how to behave and what would be acceptable. Mirroring someone is a 
coping mechanism they developed to fit into their world. Mirroring helped them get others to attach to them since they are not able to 
attach themselves to others. They use this tool to help you feel connected to them. The commonalities are there and then you can have a 
friendship or a relationship with them.


A narcissist summed this up succintly for me…he said, “I lie because it makes my life easier for me, and I get what I want that way with 
the least effort and smallest investment of my time.” (notice all the I, I, I and me, me, me)

seizing control of your agency in everything they do.

Everything they did right from the start was to subvert or destroy your ability to make wise, self-nurturing choices, by painting lies 
over your eyes, by messing with your emotions, by misrepresenting themselves and you and everything else favourably like a sales spiel, by 
playing clever trust games which are actually covert control games. And by making decisions on behalf of you, without consent and without 
consultation.

All of these things, everything they did right from the start, are all linked by one commonality. It is to destroy your agency.

In social science, agency is the capacity of individuals to act independently and to make their own free choices.

Agency (sociology) - Wikipedia

Before they even cause you the slightest bit of distress for the very first time, they are already showing their hatred for you by 
covertly hating you for your ability to act independently and to be authentically you. They cannot stand that, and must destroy your very 
independence and your ability to express yourself through your own choices. They cannot stand you being you. It irritates them in a way 
that exceeds my ability to articulate it. They must renovate you ASAP. And to do that, they will first tear out your ability to perceive 
truth through positive gaslighting so that they can install whatever pleases their whim later in that newly created empty space.

Hence their compliments actually all come from a dark place. A place of subversion and intolerance.

They erase you in everything they do. Their lovebombing is actually just an act of erasure, that’s why it’s called ‘bombing’, you do not 
bomb your loved ones, bombing cannot be patient, or kind, bombing is an emotionally violent act of suppression. Erasure is a form of 
hatred for you. You would only wish to erase something that displeases, not something that delights. You displease them from the very 
start. Everything they do is an act of erasure because everything actually displeases a narcissist. Lovebombing can also be called 
positive gaslighting. Since gaslighting comes from a place of hatred, lovebombing is them killing your agency with positivity.

The negative gaslighting they will do later in the relationship is just a different approach, now to kill your agency with negativity. At 
least negative gaslighting is more genuine.

Lovebombing (i.e. positive based, passive aggressive hatred) really creeps me out when I see the hate covertly hidden behind the 
ostentatious love. By smothering you through lovebombing, they force you to love them. It is an act of hatred masked as love.

Narcissists are living in their own SIM game. There is a script, a story or a narrative. If the story is “I am sophisticated. I take my 
wife out to fancy restaurants and I dress well. Everyone is impressed by how I look. I have impeccable social skills and I dazzle the 
masses. The little people are intrigued by my interesting stories and my beautiful wife.” Then guess what? He’s going to take his wife out 
to a fancy restaurant. She better do herself up nice. He’s going to make friendly, pleasant conversation with the valet and the hostess 
and the waitress. He’s going to be the belle of the ball and dazzle the masses with his impeccable charm. He’s going to be “nice” because 
that’s the story. If someone gets a flat tire outside the front of the restaurant, he’s going to be right there “most interesting man in 
the world” style to save the day. That’s the story. The waitress is going to hang on his every word as he bestows his sophisticated 
monologue onto her. He’ll probably leave a decent tip, because that’s the story.

So when are narcissists mean?

What if his wife dresses down for this grand event? What if she doesn’t put on makeup or what if she wears jeans?

What if the valet doesn’t really look at him?

What if the waitress is busy and doesn’t really have time to listen to his monologue?

What if the people with the flat tire say “Oh thanks, but we have roadside assistance.”?

Ouch.

His story is ruined. And someone is going to pay for that. Depending on his personality, he might mutter some insult at the people with 
the flat tire. He might berate his wife and tell her how plain she is. He might stiff the waitress. He might even be outright rude to the 
staff. Because they aren’t cooperating with his story. They are low life scumbags that don’t deserve to breathe.

Narcissists are nice to people that are following the script. They resent people that ruin the script. They take it out on anyone they 
feel they can get away with taking it out on. Probably you.

	
Narcissists don't marry just about anyone. They choose people who are their mental counterparts. It is people have a particular 
problematic personality, were also abused, and are usually co-dependent. These people are also somewhere in the narcissism spectrum.

Also, narcissists don't form love bonds within others, but “trauma bonds” [1] usually under the “slave-master complex” [2] [3] ie where 
one is the slave and the other the master. And then both play the martyrs in their own drama.

Due to the above, both parents are always narcissists, either the father is the narcissist and the mother the co-dependent, or vice versa. 
Therefore, when the narcissist parents have children, however many they are, those children will both inherit their genes, and be raised 
by their aggressive, dramatic antihuman ways. All children will receive the same upbringing that includes manufactured rivalry and chaos, 
gaslighting, threats, blames, triangulation, negativity, control, putdowns, neglect, isolation, helplessness, parents playing the child, 
and all the usual narc parenting behaviours. As a result, all children will become narcissists[4].

The only ways the children will not become narcissists is:

if their genes are in the psychopathic / autistic spectrum
if they have high IQ, which may protect them from severe trauma[5] , as long as their parents are also not very abusive to them. In that 
case they may get away without narcissism, but will still get depression or PTSD, and develop awkward social skills.
In all cases, the children will have another mental disorder. No one gets out of the “narcissist house of drama” healthy!

Narcissist parents are stars in "the family show". Specifically, “the father and mother show”. And they have predicted everything about 
their children.

At an early age, the narc mother introduces herself to it as "I am the mother! ". The narc father then introduces himself “I am the 
father! “. And both together say to the baby: “Now you’re ‘it’ and I have the power!”, a little like the introduction from “He-man”:

And that is the birth of the narcissist parents’ identity within society! The narc parents then feel they are special because they finally 
have someone who they can use as a 3rd person to prove their identity, by triangulation! And from that, they can be a part of society as 
“great people”, because they have proof that they are important: they are “the parents” that all society respects and looks up to!

From then, on they do the following:

1. They make up the rules for how other family members should be acting

The narct father and mother have made up a set of rules derived from what others believe and stereotypes they've seen and heard about how 
the other family members should act ie the sons and daughters. That is, how others should act against the father and mother, but not how 
the father and mother should act against the son and daughter.

Instead, the narcissist parents think their role is a mix of the following:

Repeating how their parents punished them when they were growing up
Ensuring the children won't get the problems themselves had at childhood
2. They blame the children from birth

The narc parents consider the children always bad. They act however comes to their head. And their ultimate arguments for reasoning it 
are, for the mother: "I am the mother. You wouldn't hurt the mother of pain would you?" and, for the father: "I am the father. You 
wouldn't hurt the old father of fear, would you? "

3. Keeping a blame score

The narc parents function by some type of rule system /” bad behavior score-keeping” in their head instead of reasoning every situation 
and discussing with others. They go by the law of, “if it happened once, it will always happen”. If someone reacted once, they are guilty 
forever and from then on they are “the aggressor” how many years pass.

So, in every interaction, the narc parents think of all the bad things their children have done to them and pick which once they may do 
next, prepare for it in their head, and act against that towards the children.

4. Build their “flying monkey network”

The narc parents then build their “ flying monkey” network. Those are about 5–6 relatives and friends, who the narc parents use as 
emotional toilets to let out their drama on, or otherwise as audience to boast about the children's achievements to.

Child did bad? The narc parent will call their emotional toilet to say how poor they are for what happened to themselves.
Child did good? That is surprising to them because the child is bad. How can bad child do good? The narc parent will tell their audience 
friends about the unexpected miracle of how their child is great. They exaggerate exactly because the narc are surprised their child is 
good, since they believe all children in the world are bad.
5. Hide the power

Narc parents have now gained the power to have someone inferior to blame. But there is still a danger: What if they lose the power?”. The 
know that the only way in which they can lose it is if they lose their role. And since they didn't really earn their parenting role 
naturally but by information, they are now worried that if their children have the information, the children may become “parents” too and 
take “the power”! So, the narc parents have to ensure no one knows about how they act and works out their behaviour.

For this, they will make sure they hide all useful information from the children. For example, the rule says “the mother cooks”. So, they 
will ensure to never teach the children how to cook, so the don't become “the mother”. On the other hand, the rule says “the father pays 
the bills”. So, they will ensure they never tell the children how they do that, because if they do, the children may become “the father”.

At the same time, the narc parents will ensure to hide from the children that they speak to the flying monkeys about them. If the children 
knew, they could make the narc parent’s power useless, since the children could talk to the flying monkeys and become “the parent”, and 
gain the impression of “great people” in society themselves.

6. Children in 3rd person

The narc parents communicate as if their children are in 3rd person. They don’t really perceive them as individuals. (really = you, the 
reader thinks they do, but they don’t). For narcissists, the children don’t “walk, move, paint, study, party”. Narcissists and 
co-dependents think of their children as follows:

The Narcissist plays the judge: “He (or she) who walks, he (or she) who moves, he (or she) who paints, he (or she) who studies, he (or 
she) who parties”
The Co-dependent plays the possessor of bodies: “My child who walks, my child who moves, my child who paints, my child who studies, my 
child who parties”
And they communicate with their children in the same way. They don’t talk to the person in front of them. They talk to “him/her who 
does….” and co-dependents to “my child who does….”.

After they have gathered information about “what their children do” which is any independent action the children had that they learnt on 
their own, most of which because the narc parents didn’t teach them about those things. The narc parents then go to their flying monkey 
network and talk in 3rd person about the children:

The Narcissist talks about “he (or she) who walks, he (or she) who moves, he (or she) who paints, he (or she) who studies, he (or she) who 
parties” and then acts as if himself/herself is so great and special. The Narcissist is very excited. For him/her, it is a miracle. He/she 
thinks there is finally justice in the world. While all children are bad, this child is good, because it managed to do all things that bad 
children don’t do. Moreover, as the narcissist didn’t teach or advise the child about any of these things, the narcissist thinks the child 
acts as such because it was magically influenced by the narcissist’s imaginative powers! Essentially, the narcissist is bragging that 
“It’s an automatic success machine!”

If, however, the children have done something bad, the narcissist will start complaining. The narcissist will say: “Do you know what 
he/she did to me?”, “How could they do this to me?”.

The co-dependent talks about “my child who walks, my child who moves, my child who paints, my child who studies, my child who parties” and 
acts as if himself/herself is so great and special. The co-dependent is also extremely happy. For him/her it is also a miracle. He/she 
thinks there is finally justice in the world. While all children as bad, this child is good, because it managed to do all these things 
that bad children don’t do. Moreover, since he/she didn’t teach the child to do all these things, he/she thinks the child can do them 
because the child took after his/her magic body! Essentially, the co-dependent is bragging “I’ve got a second body!”

If, however, the children have done something bad, the co-dependent will start complaining. Co-dependents disown children when themselves 
feel unhappy. If the co-dependent hates the child, he/she will say “This is not my child”. If it is th co-dependent’s favorite child, the 
co-dependent will say “Do you know how much pain my second body has taken?”.




They become emotionally stunted at the age of their trauma, unable to experience more mature emotions, such as gratitude, remorse, empathy, or disinterested love. Shame is absolute anathema, a horror which must 
be propelled away as far as possible by projection or gaslighting as aggressively and urgently as possible. This explains their inability to apologize, or not be right in regards to their opinions or perceived 
needs.

In regards to handling conflicts that have to be resolved, this isn’t something narcissists do. They create conflicts, but don’t resolve them. Maintaining things in a state of chaos is a prime abuse tactic. This 
is a way of maintaining control and ruining the lives of their victims by keeping them in a state of unrest. Covert narcissists especially love these sort of passive aggressive tactics as it has plausible 
deniability built into it.

Narcissists will hold fast to their position and won’t budge for anything. Once they’ve said something, from their point of view, that settles the issue, and there’s nothing else to discuss.

Conversations between neurotypicals involve exchanging information and working together to resolve issues. For narcissists, conversations are not like that. Instead they are contests to be won. The purpose of the 
narcissist is not to share information or resolve something, but prove their superiority. They want to justify their behavior, and criticize or blame you, even when the conversation is about something benign, 
like the weather.
