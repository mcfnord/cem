<p>I'm pretty sure the doctors implanted me with a douche bag magnet. Yes, there is such a thing.</p>

<p>sorry about the phone calls last night. i was basically asleep but i remember hearing something. it was dark in the tent and i couldn't see any light on the phone. i'm very sorry that you worried.<br />
i try to &quot;over-communicate&quot; but i'll step it up another notch and that's fine with me. i always care where chloe is and that she is safe. thank you for your ongoing friendship and trust. chloe and i continue love each other immensely. she's the apple of my eye.</p>

<p><strong>Emily replies:</strong></p>
<p>I admire your patience. I admire your loyalty and faithfullness. Thank you for being Chloe Dad. I may not always be in this mindset. But I do know that she hade more to lose than gain if I did get upset and thought about ending it. It always doesn't make sense. If that makes sense, lol. I just wanted to express my admiration for you and what you did and will continually do for Chloe. I know it will not end.</p>
<p>Take care,</p>
<p>Emily</p>
