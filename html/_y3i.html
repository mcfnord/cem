<li>Vicky McKinlay, a woman who knows Chloe well, said to me once, &quot;I've been supoenaed before,&quot; She certainly knew Chloe, but how well could she know me? Other than the many positive things she said to me. She said at some point after Donna visited here, &quot;Where is the GAL? This case needs a GAL.&quot; And now there is one... perhaps we can even rely on the fact that Susan has Vicky's cellular number. Vicky is not some urgent mega-witness. I think she's very ambivalent about getting into these legal settings. I worry that she'd say that I was showing signs of stress, which I was. But she, at one point, shared that she would speak positively to changes in Chloe since residing with me. That quote is worth... how much... in this matter? Minor if we're just going for (a) I'm not an evil child ogre, and (b) Pierce County isn't doing more than unsupervised visits in my home every few days.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mariah is a care-giver with Advanced Health Care. She'd be a fine witness of Darin's behavior, which she heavily monitored and criticized. I know at this point we need physical witnesses, but I think Mariah loved Emily and me and saw some bullshit that probably stands out in her mind to this day.</p>
<p>In Spring, 2013, Donna drove Emily and Chloe to Seattle Center to meet me, and left them with me.</p>
<p>donna invited me to sleep at her house so i could attend the &quot;Ethnic Festival&quot; in the park the next day.</p>
<p>in her kitchen, i asked donna if she trusted me. she said, &quot;call me old fashioned, but an adult man shouldn't take a bath with a little girl.&quot; i told her the bath was 18 months ago, and asked again if she trusted me. she said she did. Later, Donna would call me a child, shattering Emily’s trust. Donna already promised to keep me in Chloe’s life, and yet she called me a child? Emily was pissed.</p>
<p>in 2013, donna loaned her car to me twice, both for overnight camping with emily and chloe. once was 4th of july, for two nights, and once was a month or so later, for one night, at the beach.</p>
<p>Father's day in 2012 or most likely 2013, I had planned to take Chloe to a couple's home in Olympia. No one answered at Donna's home. I called Donna's sister who said Donna was probably at church. On that day, Donna addressed her church congregation about the traits of a good father. I thought Chloe might be with her. I went to Donna's church and found Donna. Donna said Chloe was at Darin's home. I drove to Darin's home to get Chloe.</p>
<p>Later Emily awoke from her nap and called me to say she was energetic enough to join us on the trip.</p>
<p>I can't think of an uncool Manning, for example. Richard Mairs is cool. I want to like Donna, and used to like her, but now I kind of don't like her. I certainly don't show it to Chloe, and never have. I can name all Emily's aunts an uncles, nieces and nephews. Chloe also knows mine.</p>
<h2 id="in-the-superior-court-for-the-state-of-washington">IN THE SUPERIOR COURT FOR THE STATE OF WASHINGTON</h2>
<h3 id="in-and-for-the-county-of-pierce">IN AND FOR THE COUNTY OF PIERCE</h3>
<p>Respondent Emily Murphy: Visitation should be as follows:</p>
<p>The petitioner, respondent Emily Murphy and the child reside together in Pierce County, Washington.</p>
<p>There should be no change in respondent Emily Murphy's visitation and contact with the child.</p>
<p>Respondent Kyle Coker: Parental visitation should be limited because respondent Kyle Coker has engaged in the conduct which follows:</p>
<p>Willful abandonment that continues for an extended period of time or substantial refusal to perform parenting functions.</p>
<p>Respondent Kyle Coker has not seen the child since she was an infant and, with the exception of paying child support, has had no involvement with her.</p>
<p>Respondent, Kyle Coker, has never had physical custody of the child.</p>
<p>Respondent Kyle Coker is not a suitable custodian for the child because he has had no contact with the child since she was an infant, is not bonded with the child nor familiar with her ongoing needs.</p>
<p>Respondent Kyle Coker resides in the state of Florida.</p>
<p>The child has resided in the state of Washington for several years, and there is substantial evidence available in this state concerning the child's care, protection, training and personal relationships.</p>
<p>Respondent Emily Murphy, the child's mother, has been a suitable parent until recently.</p>
<p>Respondent Emily Murphy has developed significant health issues that prevent her from properly caring for the child or being a suitable custodian for her.</p>
<p>Respondent Emily Murphy's health issues are imminent and terminal.</p>
<p>Petitioner is Emily Murphy's significant other.</p>
<p>Petitioner has been surrogate father for the child for several years, and is closely bonded with her.</p>
<p>The child is close to the petitioner and calls him &quot;Dad.&quot;</p>
<p>Petitioner performs the majority of the parenting functions for the child and provides for the child, and is willing to continue to do so.</p>
<p>Respondent Emily Murphy asked the petitioner to file a related adoption petition and has joined in this petition in order to ensure that the child is protected, that the child's needs are met and that the child has the stability and continuity that she will need in the event of her mother's death.</p>
<h3 id="best-interest-of-the-child">Best Interest of the Child</h3>
<p>The requests made in this petition are in the best interests of the child because:</p>
<p>The child has no relationship with respondent Kyle Coker.</p>
<p>The petitioner and respondent Emily Murphy began dating when the child was not quite two years old.</p>
<p>At the time petitioner and respondent Emily Murphy began dating, petitioner formed a strong relationship with the child.</p>
<p>Since that time the petitioner and the child have seen each other on a regular basis.</p>
<p>There was a lapse in time when the petitioner and respondent Emily Murphy were not dating, however, the petitioner's visitation and contact with the child continued throughout that time.</p>
<p>Respondent Emily Murphy has a terminal illness that has recently worsened to the point that she can no longer properly care for the child.</p>
<p>In December 2013, the petitioner, the respondent Emily Murphy and the child began living together, and the petitioner assumed the majority of parenting functions associated with raising the child.</p>
<p>The child calls the petitioner &quot;Dad&quot; and is closely bonded with him.</p>
<p>The petitioner loves the child as if she were his own child, and is willing and able to provide for her.</p>
<p>Due to the uncertainty of respondent Emily Murphy's medical status, the child needs the continued support and security which the petitioner has provided and can provide for her, and is more than willing to do so.</p>
<p>The child's mother, respondent Emily Murphy, believes that<br />
it is in the child's best interest for petitioner to adopt<br />
the child or, at a minimum, to be the child's legal custodian or guardian.</p>

Of Attorneys for Petitioner</p>
<p>I, Emily R. Murphy, join in the above petition. I understand that by joining in the petition, a decree or judgment and order may be entered in accordance with the relief requested in the petition unless, prior to the entry of the decree or judgment and order, a response is filed and served.</p>
<h2 id="identifying-information-and-referral">Identifying Information and Referral:</h2>
<p>Emily Murphy is a 32 year old Caucasian female referred to Options for a Mini-Mental State Examination to assist with the decision making process for custody of her 6 year old daughter. Emily was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer and is seeking placement of her biological daughter. Emily reported no significant psychological history and graduated with an associate’s degree prior to the cancer diagnosis. The examination was completed at Emily’s home due to pain and physical limitations due to the brain tumors. During the evaluation some accommodations in environment were made due to her high level of pain and poor motor skills in her dominant hand.</p>
<h2 id="mini-mental-state-examination">Mini-Mental State Examination</h2>
<p>Testing results of the MMSE show that Emily scored 24 of 30 points which suggests that Emily currently suffers mild cognitive impairment.<br />
However, upon further examination 4 of the 7 points missed were in the attention and calculation section which suggests that sustained attention and sustained complicated calculations are difficult for her. On all other subtests she was able to complete the sections without difficulty missing only 3 other points. During the writing of a sentence and drawing portion of the examination the items were difficult to read due to her problems with motor coordination and using the non-dominant hand. However the sides of the figures were correct and the writing made a complete sentence despite being difficult to read. Overall results suggest mild impairment in complex and sustained calculations. All other portions of the examination were within normal limits suggesting only mild impairment.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>January 25<sup>th</sup> at hospital, Donna expressed remorse to me that she had said mean things about me during the 2nd adoption meeting, exclaims, “People say your love is better than mine.” I assure her that’s impossible.</p></li>
<li><p>February, Donna visited our home with one or two of her daughters. Donna said, &quot;thank you for taking care of emily,&quot; and gestured to offer me a hug. I rose from the couch and we hugged.</p></li>
<li><p>I called police twice with regard to the custody of Chloe. The day before the first call to police was April 11, 2014. Donna Mairs (Emily’s mother) picked Chloe up from school but did not bring her home as agreed. I called and she answered but then we were disconnected. Immediately, I called again and nobody answered. Immediately I called again. Donna then asked if Chloe could stay the night, but I declined. I picked Chloe up and returned her home.</p></li>
<li><p>At the start of 2014, Donna explained that the purchase of Richard’s truck was financed based on overtime pay, which had since disappeared.</p></li>
<li><p>Emily told Donna about Emily's plan in January, 2014. Donna claimed I was too old to raise Chloe. Huh?</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="may-3-2014">May 3, 2014</h3>
<p><strong>Letter to Jason</strong></p>
<p>Sorry to tell you Emily had a tough night of vomiting and serious headache. The serious headache is a new concern.</p>
<p>The Hospice number in the kitchen will take your call and a nurse can call you back. Patent is: Emily Rose Murphy, Birthday Nov 7, 1981.</p>
<p>Nobody goes into my office. Keep the door closed and light off.</p>
<p>The attendant can help do everything except choose medications. The attendant can pass medications to Emily that you provide. I have a specific list of medications and times in the kitchen.</p>
<p>Log all medications given on the kitchen log.</p>
<p>Keep Emily’s head elevated as high as she allows. The “comfort kit“ of medications are narcotics, so they aren’t in the kitchen.</p>
<p>If she begins vomiting, get a lorazipan from the top shelf black lock box in my office. Soak it in a spoon of water for 60 seconds and turn it into a paste (or just soften it). Put this under her tongue/on her gums. If she has a serious headache, get an oxycodone from the same lock box. Soak it in a spoon of water for 60 seconds and turn it into a paste (or just soften it). Put this under her tongue/on her gums. PREVENT headaches rather than treating them by giving her an adequate and sustained dose of oxycodone. This also PREVENTS nausea.</p>
<p>Guests must be approved, and must whisper.</p>
<p>Emily is not likely to have a seizure, but during a seizure, hold her and assure you won’t leave her. Afterwards, pull the oxygen machine in Chloe’s room away from the wall, turn it on, and feed it into her nose. Immediately provide 2 anti-seizure suppositories from the kitchen.</p>
<p>If the room gets hot, open the window completely for a while. (Remove the stick that blocks it shut.)</p>
<h3 id="motion">MOTION</h3>
<p>Order that John Dempsey, the petitioner herein, by authorized to access the child's school and medical records, and to consent to any educational programs on behalf of the child and to any medical treatment that the child may need, including obtaining current immunizations for her and registering/enrolling the child in camps and therapy programs.</p>
<p>Respondent Kyle Coker should also be required to appear and show cause why the court should not enter a temporary order which:</p>
<p>Grants the petitioner custody of the following child: Chloe Murphy.</p>
<p>John R. Dempsey states:</p>
<p>I am the petitioner in this nonparental custody action.<br />
Respondent Emily Murphy is my significant other. The minor child, Chloe Murphy, is Emily's daughter. Respondent Kyle<br />
Coker is Chloe's father.</p>
<p>I am Chloe Murphy's surrogate father. I have known Chloe since she was almost two years old. Chloe is now six. She calls me &quot;Dad.&quot;</p>
<p>Emily Murphy and I have been in a relationship for several years. Emily has terminal brain cancer. We recently moved in together so that I could assist with Emily's care and take care of Chloe. Our plan is for me to take care of Chloe after Emily passes away.</p>
<p>Emily has consented to my request to adopt Chloe, and joined in my petition to obtain custody of her. Additionally, Emily signed a power of attorney for health care (Exhibit &quot;A&quot; hereto) in which she designated me as guardian for Chloe and authorized me to make health care decisions for Chloe.</p>
<p>Kyle Coker is Chloe's father. He lives in Florida, and has not seen Chloe since she was an infant. Like Emily, Mr. Coker signed a written consent for me to adopt Chloe.</p>
<p>Issues developed in the adoption case when one of Emily's family members alleged that I had sexually abused Chloe. I steadfastly deny all such allegations. Emily denied the allegations. Child Protective Services investigated and determined that the allegations were unfounded. I have requested a full copy of CPS' records and will provide those to the Court upon receipt. Nevertheless, the adoption has not been finalized.</p>
<p>Due to concerns about Emily's continued ability to care for Chloe, I commenced this action so that I could obtain legal custody of Chloe. Emily joined in the petition. Mr. Coker has been served, yet has not filed a response. I believe that he is concerned about having to pay child support.</p>
<p>Emily receives HOSPICE care in our apartment. Her condition has worsened. Emily is fighting hard against the cancer, but she is close to being incapacitated.</p>
<p>Emily can no longer actively participate in raising Chloe. I perform all of the parenting functions for Chloe. I take Chloe to and from school. I make sure that Chloe goes to Bridges and Gilda's Club therapy programs for bereavement and cancer support. I talk with counselors, therapists and social workers to understand Chloe's needs. I ensure that Chloe is fed, dressed and that her other needs are met.</p>
<p>I am at the point that I need legal authority to take care of Chloe. I am concerned that Emily's designation of me as guardian for Chloe is not sufficient. By way of example, Chloe would benefit from attending the Gilda cancer camp this summer and needs updated immunizations to do so. At a minimum I cannot enroll Chloe in the camp.</p>
<p>Chloe is only six years old. She needs continued the stability that I have provided for her, especially given the pending loss of her mother. Ex parte restraining orders are necessary in order to maintain the status quo and to provide the greatest protection to Chloe.</p>

<h3 id="to-whom-it-may-concern">To Whom It May Concern:</h3>
<p>It’s all about Chloe. My name is Pat. I happen to be John Dempsey’s stepmother, but I am writing as a veteran, award-winning teacher who specialized in at-risk children. During my 42 year career in education I always gravitated toward students who were outside the mainstream – who were at risk of failure in school. Students with special needs are diverse. Some are academically challenged. Some are medically challenged. And many are emotionally challenged. Many fail to thrive. Others exhibit amazing resilience despite having enormous challenges. I want to talk about how children attain the resilience to succeed in school and in life, because...</p>
<p>It’s all about Chloe. It turns out those students who overcome many challenges and succeed in school and through adulthood possess some common characteristics. Researchers coined the term resilience to describe the commonality of those who succeed in spite of difficult circumstances. Resilience does not depend on IQ, nor does it depend on socio-economic status. It does depend on positive and supportive relationships within the family. The researchers conducted long-term studies that examined what factors create resistance to adversity and adaptation that leads to positive coping skills that are not possessed by others in similar situations.</p>
<p>It’s all about Chloe. Families are formed through choice. Biological choice is only one way to make a family. Many families are formed through common bonds that support positive growth. Resilience studies have shown that having a positive mentor to model coping skills and learning skills can be instrumental for a child’s success, particularly when the child faces adversity and loss that she does not understand. A strong positive relationship is key to a family that grows closer over time. Unconditional love and positive guidance cannot erase a tragedy, but it can be a mediating factor that allows healing over time.</p>
<p>It’s all about Chloe. The strong, positive mentor (aka father figure) does not just monitor the basic needs of food, shelter, and safety. The involvement of the mentor in the well-being of the child includes caring for the mind and its growth. The mentor respects the child as a person, helps to motivate the child to work hard in school and shares interests and creativity with the child. This does not mean the mentor is childish; rather, it means that the mentor has the ability to reach the child through understanding childlike behavior and thought processes.</p>
<p>It’s all about Chloe. Chloe has chosen John as her Dad (mentor) and I believe that choice should be respected. She may have a traumatic event in her near future, and she needs all the support that her family members and friends can contribute. She needs to know that she is not alone.</p>
<p>Sincerely yours,</p>
