<p>Case: Dempsey<br />
Date: 8-7-14<br />
Place: Pierce County Fair, Graham Time: 12:45 pm – 2:45 pm Supervisor: Charlotte Person Requesting Report: John Dempsey</p>
<p>Brief Outline of Visitation</p>
<p>This report is in reference to the supervised visitation between John Dempsey and a child, Chloe Murphy. John Dempsey is fic of kin not a biological family member to this child. Therefore, John Dempsey will be referred to as Mr. Dempsey or John throughout this report. This visit was held at the Pierce County Fair in Graham. Mr. Dempsey’s Mother was present during this visit. There was a lot of confusion as to where to drop off and pick up Chloe at this visit. I would ask that in the future all parties adhere to the transportation, and exchange plans as indicated in the confirmation e-mail. As a professional supervisor, it is my responsibility to ensure the safety of the child and that all parties abide by the guidelines. I arrived at the fairgrounds and called Melissa who was to drop off and exchange Chloe with me. Melissa did not answer her cellular phone. I left a message giving instruction to meet me at the pay booth to the parking area as previously discussed in the email. Mr. Dempsey met me at the pay booth, where he paid for my parking and ensured I received a fair admission ticket. Mr. Dempsey had also purchased a ticket in advance for Chloe to enter the fair with me. Mr. Dempsey and I agreed to meet at the walk in entrance to the fair after I received Chloe. I parked my car and received a call from Melissa who had already entered the fair through the pedestrian entrance and at that time made contact with Mr. Dempsey. I asked Melissa to not leave Mr. Dempsey and Chloe until I had made my way to their location. As I walked toward their</p>
<p>location, Mr. Dempsey and Chloe were making their way to me.</p>
<p>Chloe appeared very excited speaking very fast and excited with her eyes fixed on Mr. Dempsey. Mr. Dempsey appeared happy and excited while engaged in this conversation with Chloe. We entered the walk gate and met Melissa and Mr. Dempsey’s Mother. I confirmed with Melissa that I would meet the Maternal Grandmother at the pay booth at the end of the visit to exchange Chloe. I informed her there was plenty of room on the roadway for the Maternal Grandmother to pull over and park to wait without entering the fair parking lot. Melissa informed me that Chloe’s fair admission was already paid for as they entered through the pedestrian gate. I returned the ticket to Mr. Dempsey that he had previously purchased for Chloe.</p>
<p>Mr. Dempsey engaged with Chloe throughout the entire visit. They rode on the bumper cars in separate cars. They laughed and smiled bumping into each other and other people. Mr. Dempsey allowed Chloe to set the pace of the visit asking her which activity she would like to do next. They conversed throughout the fair about each activity. Mr. Dempsey and Chloe conversed about the animals, insects, artwork, flowers, and plants. Chloe wanted to play in the bouncy house. As we approached the bouncy house, the attendant wanted Mr. Dempsey to sign paperwork with a signature of a parent or guardian. Chloe stated Mr. Dempsey was really not her dad but like her dad. Mr. Dempsey stated he was neither her legal parent nor guardian at this time. The attendant was adamant about knowing Mr. Dempsey and Chloe’s situation. Mr. Dempsey did not divulge information but did sign the paperwork as neither parent nor guardian allowing Chloe to play in the bouncy house. Chloe rode the appropriate sized rides. Mr. Dempsey smiled and waved to her, as she passed him watching her. Mr. Dempsey and Chloe shared a corndog. Chloe went through the home fire escape exhibit. As Chloe emerged from the mock room filled with imitation smoke, Mr. Dempsey cheered her on to find the mailbox, which was the safe location outside a burning home. They laughed and smiled. As we made our way through the exhibits and rides, one of the children who came to the fair with Melissa approached Mr. Dempsey in tears and appeared very upset stating that they had lost the two-year-old child. Mr. Dempsey tried to comfort the child asking her what she was talking about. When the child explained they could not find the two-year-old child. Mr.</p>
<p>Dempsey tried to settle the child down by stating it would be okay they would find her. During this conversation, a woman approached the child and stated the two year old was currently at the fire department exhibit. Melissa then approached and the woman informed her where the child was located. Mr. Dempsey then told the child everything was okay they had found the two year old. Melissa and the child parted way with us. With only a few minutes left to visit, Chloe wanted to ride the bumper cars with Mr. Dempsey one last time. Melissa and the children approached us. The children began to tell Mr. Dempsey about their items they had purchased at the fair. Mr. Dempsey politely explained they only had a few minutes left and Chloe wanted to ride the bumper cars again. Mr. Dempsey excused himself and we went to the bumper cars. They rode the bumper cars again in separate cars.</p>
<p>As we made our way toward the exit, Chloe expressed she did not want to leave Mr. Dempsey. Mr. Dempsey reassured Chloe he would see her on Saturday. As we were walking out, Melissa was waiting at the exit area to the parking lot. Melissa explained that she was waiting for the Maternal Grandmother to pick them up and that she would take Chloe. I walked with Mr. Dempsey, his mother and Chloe out to the parking lot. Chloe then went with Melissa and the other children to meet the Maternal Grandmother while Mr. Dempsey and his mother made their way to their vehicle. Melissa and Mr. Dempsey hugged before leaving. As I left the parking area, Melissa was waiting for the Maternal Grandmother at the parking area entrance it was after 2:45 pm.</p>
