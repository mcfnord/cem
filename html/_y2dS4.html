<h1 id="fall-comes">Fall Comes</h1>
<p>Around 2010, Donna and Richard Mairs financed a major home remodel using credit cards. The remodel was not completed. Substantial debt remained into 2011 and likely remains today. In a meeting in Fall 2013, Darin expressed concerns that benefits earned by Emily's Marine service intended for Chloe would instead finance Mairs home debt. The Mairs home is large. It has housed 6 people. It now houses 3.</p>

<h2 id="a-letter-he-sent-emily-i-added-bold">A letter he sent Emily (I added <strong>bold</strong>)</h2>
<p><strong>From:</strong> Michael Howard</p>
<p><strong>Sent:</strong> ‎12/‎8/‎2013 9:08 PM</p>
<p><strong>To:</strong> Emily Murphy</p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> RE: Change of guardianship</p>
<p>Dear Emily,</p>
<p>I intentionally did not respond immediately because I am busy with other commitments and I wanted to think about my reply. I also wanted to find out a little more about what you were thinking, hence my mail asking you the three questions.</p>
<p><strong>Shortly after I did your will</strong>, you had the surgery down in California. Almost immediately afterword <strong>your dad contacted me about your desire to change the guardian provisions in your will and make John Chloe's guardian</strong>. Given how sure you were about your guardian decisions before the surgery, this represented a huge shift. I spent a significant amount of time talking to Darin, thinking about your situation and researching the impacts of the type and extent of surgery you had undergone. I also want to be clear that I communicated with your father because you told me it was ok for me to do so.</p>
<p>It was my concern that you did not have testamentary capacity so soon after such a major surgery. I felt that, at a minimum, (1) more time needed to pass for you to become stable post surgery and (2) it was important to get a letter from your doctor clearly stating in writing that you had the mental and emotional capacity to understand and rationally make such a big change and important decision. Without additional recovery time and a doctor's letter, I felt it was not <strong>ethical</strong> to for me to make any changes to your guardian designation at that time</p>
<p>I have recently spoken with both you and your dad again; before your e-mails of this last week. What I came away with was that your medical condition had gotten worse, rather than better, and you were attempting to schedule another surgery. <strong>You told me that you wanted John to be Chloe's guardian</strong>. Then a day or so later Darin contacted me and stated that you wanted to change your guardian designation to he and Mariella. I was told that John had clearly expressed he did not feel he was an appropriate guardian and did not want to be appointed. Then I was told there had been a series of discussions between you, your dad, your mom and step-dad and John over a long weekend and that, based on everyone communicating, it had been decided to leave the guardian designation as drafted in your will.</p>
<p>And now, you contact me again and, again, <strong>John</strong>'s name is on the table. So here is what I believe to be the best course of action. I am not willing to do any work on your guardian designation unless there has been a meeting of everyone concerned and you are all in agreement on who should be appointed Chloe's guardian. By everybody, I mean you, John if he's still part of this picture, your dad and your mom and step-dad. If all of you do not agree on who should be guardian, I will not make any changes unless you have a doctor's letter stating that you have the mental and emotional capacity to understand and rationally make a new guardian designation. If you can document universal agreement of all the involved people or, absent a universal agreement, provide me with a doctor's letter, I will help you. If you have neither an agreement nor a doctor's letter, I am not willing to make any changes to your estate plan.</p>
<p>Yours Truly,</p>
<p>Michael Howard</p>
<h2 id="a-letter-id-like-to-send-him">A letter I’d like to send him</h2>
<p>Dear Mr. Howard,</p>
<p>Hello. I’m appointed to carry out wishes set forth in the will of Emily Rose Murphy, which you prepared. I believe files in your possession specify what Ms. Murphy wished, in concrete language, pertaining to disputed matters. Delivery of these files could only support your client in the settling of her estate. Regrettably, you’re delaying this estate’s closure.</p>
<p>I see parallels with Ms. Murphy’s experience. Your decisionmaking methodology and intentional delay interacting with Ms. Murphy caused her distress and required her to seek replacement counsel to complete estate planning during a painful period of her short life. I’ve attached a germane email thread. Many medical and legal professionals found your insistence on either full group consent or a precise medical determination worthy of criticism. For next time, be aware that the Mini-Mental Status Examination is the proper evaluation tool in this circumstance. I encourage you to donate your $500 fee to the Wounded Warrior Fund.</p>
<p>Your letter dated xx points out that Ms. Cox and I have presented different requests. Ms. Cox can clarify the scope of her information request, which is limited to her fiduciary responsibility. My own query spans all executor agency power. I’ve attached my previous signed request, and clarify its scope here:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Every communication involved in preparing the Estate and Will, including meeting agendas and logs, notes, such as hand-written notes, and a log of all parties present for the procedures associated with preparation of these Estate and Will documents.</p></li>
<li><p>Content and metadata of all emails and calls made to and received from Emily Murphy, and to and from all other parties contributing to the preparation of her Estate and Will in any capacity.</p></li>
<li><p>Emails can be passed to me as a comprehensive digital bundle of all communications both to and from all parties. For telephone calls, please specify the time, duration, and initiant of each call, and summarize each call’s topics and details.</p></li>
<li><p>This request is not limited to services provided prior to Ms. Murphy’s death. Please enumerate all communications involving Ms. Murphy’s estate in your practice both before and after her passing.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The specifics of the wishes of Ms. Murphy on matters now in dispute are of premier importance. I wish to close this estate for its beneficiary, so rush your reply, and I’ll rush mine.</p>
<p>John Dempsey</p>
<p>P.S. I’ve attached the deposition of Darin Murphy, in which you are mentioned.</p>

<p><strong>From:</strong> John</p>
<p>Hi, Emily.</p>
<p>I still need to do a few things in the Seattle apartment before January.</p>
<p>I talked with Harry and Rachel about my fears and hopes. Of course I fear that things might fall apart. But I should also think about things going well for us 3.</p>
<p>I think it's critical that we build trust. Our relationship is warm and we have fun together. We are friends. We can't just battle when we disagree like we have in the past. We can't just push for changes that don't make sense. We need to listen and communicate. We have to try to cooperate even when we disagree. Drugs and alcohol can make that much harder. Living together better sound like a square and serious challenge, not a party.</p>
<p>I don't support anything crazy. I can't. I can't just jump in the truck and sneak into your house at night. I can't keep you up late. If you are not healthy, rested, and nourished, guess what: You can give doctors doubts. Priorizing lust and making teenager choices can wreck everything. So I am going to be a hardass. I hope you understand why.</p>
<p>There are many goals we must accomplish when we move in together. I Can't Fuck It Up. Like, I could ignore my feelings until they explode. I could fail to build a network of supporters and helpers. You or I could drown in drugs or alcohol. There are plenty of ways to fuck this plan up. We must stay focused on very serious needs.</p>
<p>And there are logistics. I absolutely oppose any junk in the apartment. The space there is for people, not crap. How can we achieve this? It could be wise to throw all your property into a storage unit nearby, and then pull out just the things you find essential. What do you think of that idea?</p>
<p>I look forward to this new chapter in my life. I hope we approach this with honesty and maturity. I know you are excited and that's great. But please size up the very serious aspects, of our emotional needs, our long-term needs, and such. I want us to have fun. The only way we really can is if we are being honest with each other, respecting each other, and building trust.</p>
<p>Love and hugs, warmth and quiet time cuddling, from your friend,</p>
<p>John</p>

That's a long ass letter. Why don't you come over for breakfast and talk about it 😊<br />

<p>I can remind E to refill a medication to this address. I can confirm she has taken her meds. I can do all the dishes and take out the trash. I can automate and organize everything. I can build a safer bedroom.</p>
<p>Today Chloe had a meltdown. It was good that she got onto the new leather couch, under a cozy blanket, and just felt better. That's where I want things to be. Cozy by the heater or on the cozy couch. Cry if you need to in this cozy place.</p>
<p>E has improved since we moved here. There was so much turmoil, and before living with me she had a less stable life. They both did. Moving them all together was a big gamble. Of course, right? I took a gamble. It has worked out.</p>
<p>Now all tasks compete for my attention, and most get left behind. Like watching shows. Who needs it? T.V. is a great thing to toss out for extra time. And play badminton in the livingroom with C? That's time well spent. I'm not saying it's all excellent. Some time with her is tedious, frustrating, or just boring. But usually better than being alone.</p>
<p>Still can't quite believe I've got haters.﻿</p>
<p><strong>Walter Wittel responds:</strong></p>
<p>Just 2 sentences on the haters. Good balance. Good priorities.</p>

<p><strong>From:</strong> John</p>
<p><strong>To:</strong> Nicole Barrett, Madigan Oncology</p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Sgt. Emily Murphy</p>
<p>Hi, Nicole.</p>
<p>The condition of Sgt. Emily Murphy (last 4: 2539) has worsened.</p>
<p>She is much weaker. She has very little stamina. She can only get up sometimes without help. Thankfully she does not fall much, but has fallen due to weakness in the bathroom.</p>
<p>She is very sleepy, but does wake up, especially in the evenings.</p>
<p>Her left hand is now numb.</p>
<p>She lacks bladder control. She also can't pee sitting down so well as when she is standing, which makes trips to the bathroom frustrating.</p>
<p>Her vision is going double (I believe) occasionally, and she cannot focus at these times. At these times she may be prone to nausea and has vomited. She said one eye seems to be bulging.</p>
<p>She reports that she is occasionally &quot;very dizzy&quot;.</p>
<p>Headaches are more frequent.</p>
<p>We have gotten her a walker and a wheelchair. We believe a bar by the bed and perhaps one in the bathroom can contribute to independence.</p>
<p>Tricare has marked the request for in-home occupational therapy as &quot;pending&quot;. We are waiting for this approval.</p>
<p>I will be with Emily in the Oncology department Thursday, April 3rd, at 1:30pm. I hope to see you then.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>John Dempsey</p>

<p>I witnessed Donna shame Chloe in May, 2014 over a minor detail discrepancy that Chloe could not have known: I said I would call her teacher but met with her instead. Donna interrogated Chloe about this discrepancy, even though Chloe had no way to know I had changed the contact approach. Chloe was visibly frightened by this interrogation. I believe she was expected to feel ashamed for an error she had no awareness of. I believe this shame is part of a pattern Donna uses to control juveniles. I believe this tactic has caused substantial harm to juveniles she has raised.</p>
<p>Donna shows hostility toward me in front of Chloe in ways Chloe finds very distressing. My attempts to reach out to Donna have been unsuccessful. Chloe describes &quot;being in the middle&quot; as a terrible feeling. I do not criticize Donna or any other family members in front of Chloe.</p>
