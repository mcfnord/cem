<p>Enough of you have asked for the background story on my Facebook posting that I think I will try to give you a history lesson. Our son John was in love with Emily Rose and her daughter Chloe. Emily spent the better part of six years, and worked through endless discussions, trying to decide who would be the best dad for Chloe if anything happened to Emily. There was some urgency and Emily knew it and John knew it and even Chloe was aware that her mother had stage IV brain cancer. Emily died but not until she had begun several processes which would have allowed John to adopt Chloe.</p>
<p>When Emily died many believed there was a lot of money from insurance etc. on the table. Five or six years ago while Emily was still an enlisted officer in the Marine Corps she began a series of conversations about Chloe's future and when she died without having achieved her dream of securing John's position as Chloe's dad Emily's estranged parents came crawling out of the woodwork. Filing and counter-filing became a way of life with complaints filed all the way from Olympia (CPS) to Superior Court in Tacoma. Every single allegation was met, argued and defeated. John was on his way to legally becoming Chloe's dad. And then progress went south.</p>
<p>John, who works in software in Seattle, had had court encounter after court encounter with this or that relative operating under the guidance of legal counsel Heather Young. John was probably tired after coming to Tacoma over 40 times to visit with his daughter under the watchful supervision Community Family Services headed by Christine Hansen. The supervision was required because of complaints from Emily's family that John was somehow &quot;perverted.&quot; Each of the 40+ visit reports characterize John as a remarkable and talented human being who makes a wonderful job of raising Chloe. On January 1, 2015 John posted on his Facebook page for his &quot;friends&quot; link to a music video made in Russia using GoPro’s Hero camera in the first-person-shooter mode along with a six word caption. The substance of the video looked like any game or video in that modality. The video sat on the Facebook page for several days until one of John's &quot;friends&quot; in Mexico sent the link as URL to Emily's family. In the words of Heather Young when she called the Tacoma Police Department's business line the video was, &quot;inappropriate.&quot; Young acted as the &quot;point man&quot; and involved a number of her clients and their family friends and business associates to generate charges arguing that the video was a threat.</p>
<p>John could no longer visit Chloe and was subsequently charged with four specific charges of felony crimes. Our family stood behind John with a lot of his friends and the prosecutor's office eventually made an offer that would have probably saved him a lot of trouble but made him appear guilty. The Pierce County Prosecutor, Mark Lindquist, immediately escalated the issue by going on television and telling the public what a horrible person our son is. Our son was subsequently arrested even though he had never been interviewed by any police. As soon as he declined the prosecutor' s offer that he plead guilty to a reduced series of charges the Pierce County prosecutor's office immediately added three more felony charges one of which carried considerable jail time.</p>
<p>John was bailed out of jail by the family and continued to go to his job in Seattle while making runs back to once again be able to visit Chloe under horrific conditions mandated by Chloe's maternal grandmother. If we thought he was tired before New Year's Day he is now surely much more exhausted and yet he persevered and over the course of time and specifically today he is &quot;not guilty&quot; of any of the charges pressed by those involved in the custody hearings in Family Court through the Pierce County Prosecutor. So I said, “Our son has been acquitted on all counts! We are very pleased with the verdict. “ and you asked and now you have more detail.</p>
