<p>my life became hell! oh, what a hell it was. but i didn't know why the hell came. i just knew something was up between Chloe's mom and me. Two weeks ago Chloe's mom said Chloe couldn't spend the night at my house... that I'm not really family... suddenly things were more complicated. What? Chloe and I were freaked out.</p>
<p>WTF? I couldn't really ask... cuz her mom was getting brain cancer surgery! And then she came back from surgery and had to go straight into the hospital. So for two weeks I was wondering WTF.</p>
<p>So I get through to Emily in the hospital. And she says that when we were leaving for Mexico, great-grandma saw me touch Chloe inappropriately. So... the family took her to a sexual assault doctor, who said there were no signs of anything like that. (OF COURSE.) And basically they said &quot;ok, great-grandma is kind of weird. john's also weird but did he do this?&quot; They had 25 years of knowing me to judge with. And no, they decided nothing like that happened.</p>
<p>What a horrible sensation... first to know something has changed, but what? Then to know what happened behind the scenes. I was terribly frightened and now I'm just rage-filled. ;)</p>
<p>I wrote to grandpa (son of great-grandma) declaring my complete innocence and revulsion. But like I said he already decided this was bogus. He said it's alright so long as I'm in good with Emily, and I am. [now we see he lied.]</p>
<p>Now things are somewhat back to normal. I'm building a tiny bedroom in my tiny apartment where she can sleep. Don't tell me that's &quot;risk reduction&quot; because wtf, but it's probably appropriate and timely.</p>
<p>One good aspect is that it clarified my position in the larger family and with Chloe. I am considered family (about half way) despite all the differences in how our two families interpret that. Without trust for me, there's nothing left, because trust is the only reason I can live this way. Emily wants us all to go to family therapy, so I will. She's terminally ill, and I'm a dad. Our relationships extend through most of Chloe's life. It's not &quot;traditional&quot; and that's an issue... but it's strong and everybody knows it. Forget all the crazy crap that just went down the important part is the little child.</p>

<p><strong>after a day with Emily at her hospital bed</strong></p>
<p>A bit hard to explain, but basically in Mexico apparently crazy old grandma saw me flip up Chloe's dress? or flip it down? what? To see her tiny girl parts? I don't know! It's not hard to see her girl parts if that's my goal. crazy lady.</p>
<p>At least the sickness of this psycho sideshow is just about over. Yes, people are still seriously, perhaps fatally ill. but this whole molester bullshit is sorta over. which is not quite true... it's still Mormons. that means modesty. which is fine with me, believe it or not. yes i can explain that cartwheels in dresses that show your underwear or outta bounds. not complicated nor oppressive. dress properly for cartwheels who cares end of story.</p>
<p>it's clear to me that chloe loves me like krazy. and it's clear to everyone else too. which is the best part. everyone's family but I'm special to her. and she is special to me. so don't make up some psycho narrative, legions of fear. I'm happy for what i still have.</p>

<p>I was listening to npr today. They were talking about the new cultural shifts in Mexico and how single moms are just out there and not taboo anymore. So maybe fathers are not expected to be so into their kids and maybe the grandparents were freaked out that you paid attention to her and their minds made up bull. It sucked and I am sorry for you. Crazy people.</p>
<p>Thank you for being awesome to that girl!!!</p>

<p><em>When Chloe was 5, I wrote a short vignette of Mariela being Chloe's mom. Chloe took great interest in what I wrote, and sounded surprised and deeply touched that so many words had been written for her. &quot;I'm so happy you wrote all this for me!&quot; It was probably 50 words. The next night she asked to read it to us by candle light.</em>Â </p>
