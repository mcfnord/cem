<h2 id="june-2-2014">June 2, 2014</h2>
<p>Emily had died some hours earlier and my wife, Pat, and I drove my son John Dempsey to visit Emily's remains at the home of Darin Murphy in Ruston. Emily's remains were in bed in a small room off the living room and after viewing the remains Pat suggested we give the two of them some time alone. Darin said, &quot;Sure we can talk out on the porch.&quot; We all went out to the porch where we stood silently for about 20 min. watching the neighbor’s construction project and doing very little talking. After about 20 min. of standing there, I looked at Pat and said, ”Perhaps somebody should go in and check on John.&quot;</p>
<p>Darin immediately folded his arms across his chest, bowed his neck and said, &quot;I wish you wouldn't!&quot; The move was sudden. The anger was real and we both looked at him like he had totally slipped over the edge. He seemed to realize that he had somehow been inappropriate and he immediately began shaking his head and saying, &quot;That's not what I meant. We continued to look at him as if he were plainly nuts and I said, “It's your house you can do whatever you want to.&quot;</p>
<p>The environment was charged with tension as we waited and after a couple of minutes he finally said, &quot;Yes, why don't you go and check on John?&quot; Pat went back into the house and a couple of minutes later appeared with John we walked to the car and left.</p>
<p>I would suggest anyone dealing with Darin Murphy treat him with the utmost respect as he is volatile and appears perpetually angry. I have known subject Murphy since we operated separate electronic bulletin board systems in the 1980’s. Herb Dempsey (former owner of MASTER CONTROL)</p>

<p>This report is in reference to the supervised visitation between John Dempsey and a child, Chloe Murphy. John Dempsey is fic of kin not a biological family member to this child. Therefore, I will refer to John Dempsey as Mr. Dempsey or John throughout this report. This visit was held at residence of Howard Dempsey, John Dempsey’s uncle. I met the maternal grandmother and child in front of the home. The maternal grandmother introduced me to the child and said goodbye. The child and I entered the walkway through the garage to the home where Mr. Dempsey met us outside the front door. The child and Mr. Dempsey immediately hugged and said they missed each other. They sat on a bench next to each other outside the front door for several minutes hugging. We entered the home where Mr. Dempsey offered the child food and beverages. The child asked to go to the beach, Mr. Dempsey agreed. They gathered snacks and water and we walked down to the beach. During the visit the child addressed Mr. Dempsey as daddy and John, alternating between the two. Mr. Dempsey answered to both John and daddy when the child addressed him. The child asked why she could not live with Mr. Dempsey. He responded that when her mother died rules changed but he was very glad they could be together on this day. The child told Mr. Dempsey when she was old enough to say where she wanted to live, and that she would choose with him and they would live in Seattle. Mr. Dempsey replied that was nice. The child stated the maternal grandmother would not allow her to attend “Sparkle” (?). Mr. Dempsey said the</p>
<p>grandmother makes the rules now. The child asked Mr. Dempsey why she has not been able to see him. Mr. Dempsey said when her mother passed the rules changed. Several times during the visit, the child asked how much time they had left. Mr. Dempsey would give her the correct time they had left and would follow with the comment that he was glad he was able to spend time with her today. Toward the end of the visit, Mr. Dempsey said they needed to go back to the house to prepare for her to leave. The child stated she thought she was able to spend the entire day with him. Mr. Dempsey said they had four hours together on this day. Mr. Dempsey told the child he would try to schedule something fun on their next visit such as a movie. The child asked Mr. Dempsey why he was mean to “Darren or Darrel”. Mr. Dempsey replied when her mother died he was sad. The child accepted Mr. Dempsey’s reply. During the visit Mr. Dempsey and the child engaged in sand castle building, redirecting water flow with shovels in the sand, playing in the sand and feeding carrots to the goat and pony. Mr. Dempsey and child snacked throughout the visit on popcorn, fruit snacks, breakfast bars, juice, and water. They sat next to each other conversing on the beach and deck. Mr. Dempsey and child stated they were saddened by the mother’s passing. The child stated she would be spending time with a friend of her mother who has horses. The child stated the maternal grandmother said it would be good for her to get her mind off her mother's dying. Mr. Dempsey agreed it was good for her to occupy her time having fun. Several times throughout the visit, the child would tell Mr. Dempsey that she loved and missed. Mr. Dempsey responded with same. The child hugged Mr. Dempsey several times throughout the visit while they were playing, talking, sitting or spontaneously. Mr. Dempsey returned the affection each time. While at the pond, the child wanted to enter the water. Mr. Dempsey told her that was not a good idea. While walking to the beach we had to cross railroad tracks. Mr. Dempsey told the child to wait for him and not walk ahead. At the end of the visit, Mr. Dempsey instructed the child to put her shoes on and gather her belongings. The child did not respond as readily to his requests as she had earlier when he would make requests of her. After the child was ready to leave, Mr. Dempsey and child hugged. The child and Mr. Dempsey said goodbye. The child put her head down and became very quiet as she left.</p>
<p>The child and I met the maternal grandmother out in front of the home where we exchange the child.</p>

<p>Basically it's never OK to mess with a kid's head like that.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>On June 20<sup>th</sup>, 2014, Chloe asked, &quot;Why won't you give back mom's phone?&quot; Chloe explained that someone on Emily's phone had a horse (which I had never heard before, and am not aware of any horse ride previously), and that due to my possession of the phone, she was unable to &quot;ride a horse rather than thinking about mom's death.&quot; I am executor of Emily's estate, with legal obligations that should be clear to the adults involved. Previously Darin Murphy had exerted substantial pressure to gain control of this telephone. I have never received any request for this contact’s information. An adult introduced this explanation to Chloe, abusing her in the conflict while also alienating me from her.</p></li>
<li><p>During the visit to the Puyallup Fair on September 10<sup>th</sup>, 2014, Chloe told me, “Grandma says you aren’t really family.” When I asked Chloe what she</p></li>
<li><p>thinks, she said she was not sure if I am family, but went on to say she wished to reside with me.</p></li>
<li><p>During a visit in Downtown Tacoma, on October 9<sup>th</sup>, 2014, Chloe said Donna had claimed I had voluntarily delivered Chloe to Donna because I was unable to care for her for “that week”. I said that was untrue. Chloe became upset and responded, “Grandma is trying to make me not like you! Why? Why is she doing that?” I told Chloe I did not know, and that she needed to ask Donna why. Charlotte observed and participated in the conversation.</p></li>
<li><p>Donna appears to fear Howard Dempsey, who she knows to be a retired junior high school teacher:</p>

<p>Christine, I had a question about the report on11/23 with Charlotte at the home of Howard Dempsey. Charlotte states that Howard went down stairs to watch sports on TV and Chloe followed shortly after. Mr Dempsey finished cooking the rice and we too returned downstairs. Did she leave Chloe alone with Howard downstairs?. I just want to make sure that Chloe is not to be left alone with anyone while at a visit. Let me know. [Christine’s response:} CFS follows the person being supervised, not the child.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rejection-of-entire-family">Rejection of entire family</h2>
<p>With the exception of visitations that take place at my mother's home or my uncle's home, Donna repeatedly rejected my requests to have my adult family members share my visitation with Chloe; she even refused to let them transport Chloe for visitation. This includes my father, Herb Dempsey, who is a former police officer and educator.</p>
<h2 id="alienation-effort-against-my-family">Alienation effort against my family</h2>
<p>On June 20<sup>th</sup>, Chloe said, “&quot;Grandma says I can't see you and I can't see anyone in your family, not even Epona!&quot; Donna Mairs also prohibited Howard Dempsey from attending the visit on that day at his own home. On October 1<sup>st</sup>, Chloe explained that Donna prohibits all adult members of my family from attending visits, unless the visit occurs on their own property. Chloe stated that she wished they could attend. I agreed to keep asking Donna to approve any adult member of my family. On about five occasions since, I invited Donna to choose an adult member of my family to attend a visit, or invite Chloe to choose. Donna first chose Epona, a 13 year old. When I explained that Epona was not an adult, Donna prohibited any other family members from attending. Once I failed to explicitly prohibit Epona from being chosen, so Donna chose her again. On November 8<sup>th</sup> Chloe explained that Donna’s strictness is rooted in not wanting Chloe exposed to any “bad influences.” I continue requesting the GAL to overrule this hostile effort to destroy relationships Chloe developed with Emily’s full support over 5 years, which I can substantiate with strong photographic evidence. I also strongly object to the characterization of my family as full of “bad influences,” <strong>especially in conversations with Chloe Murphy</strong>.</p>
<p>My biological family regularly took Chloe to the park, zoo, and mountain, or just played with Chloe while I cared for Emily. I have no reason to believe they are a bad influence on anyone, and Chloe misses them.</p>

<p>IN RE: Chloe Elizabeth Murphy DOB - 27 June 2007</p>
<p>Grief Counseling related to the death of Emily Rose Murphy DATE: 21 July 2014</p>
<p>At some point something has to be said. I do not know what can come as a result of having made this request but I do have some idea of what could happen if it is not written.</p>
<p>Emily Rose Murphy, now deceased, was someone with whom I had held multiple conversations over a period of five years. Emily was working to become a methodical protector of the future of her daughter Chloe Elizabeth Murphy. Emily had terminal brain cancer and died on 1 June 2014. In over a year leading to her death Emily had worked to provide counseling and to draw a path to dealing with her death for Chloe. She regularly and routinely visited, with John Dempsey and Chloe, grief counseling at Bridges in Tacoma and at Gilda's Club in Seattle where all three were members. As a part of that counseling Chloe had been accepted into the Tacoma Camp Sparkle to be held 11-14 August 2014 from 9:30 AM to 4 PM.</p>
<p>On 21 June 2014 Chloe announced that her grandmother would not allow her to attend Camp Sparkle.</p>
<p>On 19 May 2014 Chloe was seized at school and placed in state custody. When John Dempsey arrived to pick her up from school she was already in state custody. Two days later Chloe missed her first scheduled appointment in the grief counseling process developed by her mother and Dempsey. The next scheduled appointments were also missed and the trips to Gilda’s club went unattended.</p>
<p>On 11 July 2014 Chloe stated she did not need to nor want to eat anymore because her mother was dead. Emily wanted the best for Chloe and spent over a year developing the habit and expectation of regularly having trusted adults who could talk about death and dying and grief and acceptance. Emily had attended multiple counseling sessions and provided a regular schedule to be followed after her death. The transition pattern Emily established has apparently been disrupted and not without serious consequences. I do not know when child neglect becomes abuse and when abuse becomes criminal but I do know this is not good for Chloe Elizabeth Murphy and I do know her mother feared her death and the child’s current placement would have such effects on a six year old. If this request would be better received as a complaint please feel free to contact me.</p>
<p>I feel that Chloe’s attendance at Camp Sparkle could work toward giving her the will to live that she currently says she does not have. I have attached the enrollment records for Camp Sparkle and I strongly urge someone with more smarts than I work to assure that Chloe gets to attend.</p>

<p>And reports please.</p>

<p>We are unable to guarantee that a particular supervisor will always be available. Rescheduling visits will not guarantee that a particular supervisor will be available.</p>
<p>What is your basis for not wanting Sarah supervising?</p>
<p>J. Dempsey , 10/3/14, to CFS</p>
<p>I have quite a few concerns about Sarah. I have a team that reads every report. Here's feedback from one of my team members, a retired police officer, about Sarah's reports:</p>
<p>&quot;As a report it is a complete failure as there is an apparent lack of direction in the report. If the purpose of the report is to characterize the relationship between Chloe and Mr. Dempsey in a supervised setting ('These observations are of parent-child contact which occurred in a structured and protected setting.') there is way too much intrusion by the supervisor (observer making observations) who is in the role of an observer and not as a 'cop.' I taught report writing in the law enforcement academy before the WCJTC took the process under tow. Any cop worth his salary knows his report has a purpose. In my years as a field training officer the supervisor would have been relieved of duty and asked to return to the manual to review some basic principles. When Chloe gets peevish because she doesn’t get her way those in charge must deal with the behavior. The geography of that encounter is completely misunderstood by Sarah. There is never a discussion of either the etiology of the unacceptable behavior or some appropriate supervisory dialogue on how to avoid such situations in the future. She is trying to be important but I suspect nobody has told her what that means.&quot;</p>
<p>The woman who accompanied us at the zoo also trains in report-writing for emergency responders, with about 30+ years of experience. She said Sarah appeared bored, and during a critical emotional incident Sarah kept interfering. Her interventions fanned a negative behavior Chloe has learned from grandma, that of making an uproar by obstruction. The trainer also considered Sarah's attire to be inappropriate.</p>
<p>I am a professional writer. I read most reports many times, but can't read Sarah's. Sarah's reports lack a clear understanding of audience and purpose. They cover irrelevant details and miss important ones. I want to avoid needing Sarah as a witness in the March trial, because I have not seen indications that she could speak to my skill in parenting this child. My particular recollection from the Zoo was when Chloe said, &quot;I would feel so sad if I couldn't see you,&quot; and I wondered quite aloud if that would be in the report. It wasn't. Not every detail is. But the fact I &quot;rode a slug&quot; on the merry-go-round is, and the exact way I carried a cranky Chloe got documented in detail I must call lurid. Call my reaction visceral and subjective, but as a professional writer I feel sick realizing I'm paying for that writing. Meanwhile I fully endorse the report-writing skill of the other 3 supervisors I've worked with.</p>
<p>We considered passing on the reports when she supervises, but since our legal position is transparency we should not pass.</p>
<p>So we schedule further in advance and if I knew both Charlotte's and Sarah's days off I would have even more to work with.</p>
<p>I hope this clarifies.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>John</p>

<p>Wherein Kyle lies:</p>
<p>1.13 Paragraph 1.13 is denied because Respondent Kyle Coker is a suitable custodian for the child as he has repeatedly attempted to be an influential part of Chloe Murphy’s life but was prevented by the Respondent Emily Murphy.</p>
<p>Petitioner John Dempsey’s performance of parental functions for the child were brought into questions repeatedly, thus resulting in several investigations by CPS. These investigations resulted in CPS contacting Respondent Kyle Coker for permission to remove Chloe Murphy out of John Dempsey’s care when it was determined that Respondent Emily Murphy no longer retained the mental faculties required to make a sound decision regarding the care and wellbeing of Chloe Murphy.</p>
<p>Determination of Respondent Emily Murphy’s mental capabilities at the time of expressing a belief of Chloe Murphy’s future needs and requirements is under question. Furthermore such a statement is of personal opinion and cannot be entered as factual.</p>
<p>Respondent Kyle Coker requests that he be found competent and capable as Guardian of Chloe E. Murphy, and that Chloe Murphy be place into Kyle Coker’s care.</p>
<p>Respondent Kyle Coker further requests that John Dempsey have no further contact with the Child as he possesses a potential threat to her physical and mental wellbeing.</p>
<p><strong>Respondent also requests that any and all monetary trusts or funds left to Chloe Murphy by her mother for any future requirements be place in a trust governed by the maternal grandparents, Donna Mairs and Darin Murphy.</strong></p>
<p><em>There you go, their plan to get the money and you, by turning Kyle into a hand puppet!</em></p>
<p>Temporary Custody of Chloe Murphy to Richard and Donna Mairs until such time as proper and permanent placement of the child can be determined.</p>
<p><em>&quot;We'll get around to that part later!&quot;</em></p>
<p>Termination of all forms of visitation and/or communication between Petitioner John Dempsey and Chloe Murphy.</p>
<p><em>All of the sudden, Kyle says he cares! Or is this Kyle at all? Just a puppet?</em></p>
<p>Allow full unrestricted visitation and communication rights between Respondent Kyle Coker and Chloe Murphy.</p>
<p><em>Kyle told the court he wants to communice with you. Did he?</em></p>
<p>Enter antiharassent Order for Protection protecting <em>Chloe Elizabeth Murphy</em> from <em>John R. Dempsey</em>.</p>
