<p>From the moment you saw my bicycle you wanted to ride. This was the first day you joined me on the bike. If you ever put a baby on a bicycle, get them a helmet first. Shoes are also required on a bicycle! But we went super-slow and didn't lose any toes. We got you a helmet and boots. Do you remember those rides we took into the empty parking garage? I loved the few real rides we took together, where you got to feel the rush of a ride on a bicycle. I still ride my bicycle! Be safe and smart on your bicycle, and it can be a tool of freedom.</p>

<p>Coco, Kirara, and many others.</p>
<p>On a warm evening in Seattle, we left with Harry and probably Kirara to the park, where we watched <em>PeeWee's Big Adventure</em>. We did this twice, actually, on two different years. That was the same park where Coco and her little brother got in the water fountain with us. We used to play at that kid's play area, Em and I would sit at the bench and eat, or play hide-and-seek with you.</p>
<p>The hospital where I got my allergy injections had a big slide behind it.</p>
<p>I remember when we visited Seattle, and ate sushi. Em and me took you there when you were younger, too. It's my favorite sushi in Seattle. It's called HaNa, which means <em>beautiful flower</em> in Japanese.</p>
