<h1 id="some-things-are-icky">Some things are icky</h1>
<p>It is a shame that Emily Murphy has passed, leaving our daughter behind, but it is also a new opportunity for my daughter and I to develop an exceptional relationship. I am a competent and caring father already successfully raising a daughter to be an educated and productive part of our societyâ€™s future. All I ask is that I have the chance to do the same for Chloe Murphy. She is my youngest daughter and I love her with all my heart.</p>
<p>I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the state of Washington that the foregoing is true and correct.</p>
