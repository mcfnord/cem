<p>Oh friends, not these tones!<br />
Let us raise our voices in more<br />
Pleasing and more joyful sounds!</p>
<p>Joy, beautiful spark of the gods,<br />
Daughter of Elysium,<br />
We enter fire imbibed,<br />
Heavenly, thy sanctuary.</p>
<p>Thy magic reunites those<br />
Whom stern custom has parted;<br />
All men will become brothers<br />
Under thy gentle wing.</p>
<p>May he who has had the fortune<br />
To gain a true friend<br />
And he who has won a noble wife<br />
Join in our jubilation!</p>
<p>Yes, even if he calls but one soul<br />
His own in all the world.<br />
But he who has failed in this<br />
<strong>Must steal away alone and in tears.</strong></p>
<p>All the world's creatures<br />
Draw joy from nature's breast;<br />
Both the good and the evil<br />
Follow her rose-strewn path.</p>
<p>She gave us kisses and wine<br />
And a friend loyal unto death;<br />
She gave lust for life to the lowliest,<br />
And the Cherub stands before God.</p>
<p>Joyously, as his suns speed<br />
Through Heaven's glorious order,<br />
Hasten, Brothers, on your way,<br />
Exulting as a knight in victory.</p>
<p>Joy, beautiful spark of the gods,<br />
Daughter of Elysium,<br />
We enter fire imbibed,<br />
Heavenly, thy sanctuary.</p>
<p>Be embraced, Millions!<br />
This kiss for all the world!<br />
Brothers!, above the starry canopy<br />
A loving father must dwell.</p>
<p>Can you sense the Creator, world?<br />
Seek him above the starry canopy.<br />
Above the stars He must dwell.</p>
<p>Be embraced, Millions!<br />
This kiss for all the world!<br />
Brothers!, above the starry canopy<br />
A loving father must dwell.</p>
<p>Can you sense the Creator, world?<br />
Seek him above the starry canopy.<br />
Above the stars He must dwell.</p>
<p>Joy, beautiful spark of the gods,<br />

Heavenly, thy sanctuary.</p>
