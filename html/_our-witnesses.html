<h2 id="john-dempseys-witness-list">JOHN DEMPSEY'S WITNESS LIST</h2>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Kyle Coker: Chloe's biological father. Met Emily when she was in the Marines. They had rooms near each other and became involved. After Emily was pregnant Kyle moved back to what we believe is his home state - Florida - and did not see Emily again until after Chloe was born. Coker has at least two other daughters, one of whom he has indicated lives with him (a teenager). At some point in time Coker was accused of molesting one of his daughters (the teenager we think), so initially in this case Coker seemed to be a kindred spirit with John Dempsey. Coker has seen Chloe once. Emily took Chloe back to Florida to meet Coker and his family. Emily's family maintains that she only stayed overnight, and that Coker gave her the cold shoulder. In any event, Emily and Chloe did not stay long in Florida, and that ws the last time that Coker saw Chloe. Coker maintains that Emily prevented him from having a relationship with Chloe, when she learned that he had a girlfriend. Additionally, Coker was unwilling to move to the West Coast because his family and two other daughters live in Florida. Coker also maintains that an issue with him being with Emily was her Mormon religion, and that he did not want Chloe to be raised that way. Coker may owe several thousands of dollars in back child support. Emily had to file an action to collect support.<br />
Coker has been attending community college. He owns/operates a pool cleaning business. Coker has represented that he and his girlfriend are going to buy a home together.<br />
Coker has not responded to either GAL Burgess or GAL Peterson's requests that he contact them.</p></li>
<li><p>Chloe Murphy: We identified Chloe as a witness because this may be a good case in which to ask the court to speak with the child in chambers.</p></li>
<li><p>Harry Silva: Harry has been a friend of John's for several years. Harry knew Emily and spent numerous weekends and other times with Emily, John and Chloe. Harry is single. He lives in Seattle. He has no children. He is a hairdresser. Harry can provide independent information regarding John's conduct around and contact with Emily and Chloe. There was an assertion regarding the 46-second video that someone named &quot;Harry&quot; had taken the video, but Harry absolutely denies it. Harry will testify that he has videoed John, Emily and Chloe on other occasions, and that all videos were appropriate.</p></li>
<li><p>Jerris Ockfen: Jerris is John's mother. Jerris is now retired, but was a teacher for many years. She has spent a lot of time over the years with John, Emily and Chloe, and more recently has been involved with some of John's visitations with Chloe. Jerris can testify regarding the close bond between John and Chloe, and perhaps Emily's wishes that John have custody of Chloe.</p></li>
<li><p>Herb Dempsey: Herb is John's dad. Herb is a former teacher and police officer. Donna Mairs does not want Herb to be involved in the visitations between Chloe and John, or to transport Chloe even though Donna has complained about the time involved in transporting Chloe. Herb has hundreds of photographs of Chloe, Emily and John over the years at family events.</p></li>
<li><p>Pat Roberts-Dempsey: Pat is John's stepmother. She was recognized as an outstanding Washington State educator.</p></li>
<li><p>Jan Dempsey: John's sister.</p></li>
</ol>
<div id="joyce-brianne">
<ol start="10" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Joyce Robson: Joyce is an adoption attorney who prepared the adoption paperwork for John and Emily. Joyce (Joy) viewed both John and Emily as her clients, and initially thought the adoption would sail through. Joy had limited contact with Kyle Coker and made no representations to him about Emily's health. (Coker alleges that no one told him Emily was dying.) According to Joy things started to go sideways when Emily's family became involved.<br />
Joy attended a meeting with Joni Irvin, Darin Murphy, Donna Mairs, Jan Dempsey, John and Emily, during which Darin apparently dominated the meeting. Joy thought Darin was the most domineering person she had ever met, and that he was demeaning to his dying daughter, Emily. Joy thought that Jan Dempsey was a voice of reason. Nevertheless, the allegations regarding sexual abuse were sufficient to shake Joni Irvin's confidence in the adoption.<br />
Candace Zygar also sent Joni a letter, indicating her reservations about it. Joni apparently told Joy that the court would have to decide whether an adoption was in Chloe's best interest. In any event, Joy asked Joni not to issue a home study or any type of report because she was concerned it would be a negative one. Heather Young refers to the adoption process as a &quot;failed adoption.&quot; Joy disagrees with that description because no home study/report was issued. Joy recently dismissed the adoption petition without prejudice.</p></li>
<li><p>Brianne Campbell, J.D. : Joy Robson referred Emily to Brianne to address the changes she was wanting to make to her will. Brianne met with John and Emily, and then with Emily. Brianne is comfortable testifying that Emily had mental capacity to make the changes to her will, and that she was clear about wanting John to be custodian of Chloe. EMILY'S WILL AND POWER OF ATTORNEY CONTAIN SPECIFIC LANGUAGE REGARDING JOHN BEING CUSTODIAN OF CHLOE, so those documents would be good exhibits of Emily's intent.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<ol start="12" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Community Family Services supervisors: There are 3: Charlotte; Sarah; and Christine Hansen. No specific individual was listed on the witness list because I didn't know last names, or specifically who would be called.<br />
Christine Hansen only authored a visitation report.</p></li>
<li><p>Howard Dempsey: Howard is John's paternal uncle. Howard is a retired educator. Many of the supervised visitations have taken place at Howard's home, so he can testify regarding his observations of the bond between Chloe and John.<br />
He will be a good witness.</p></li>
<li><p>Jason Dempsey. Jason is John's half brother. Jason has shared custody of his own 13-year-old daughter Ebona. After relinquishing the apartment in Tacoma that he had shared with Emily and Chloe, John moved into Jason's home in SeaTac. Jason can testify regarding John's relationship with Chloe.</p></li>
<li><p>John Sterbick, J.D. John Sterbick had done some legal work for John Dempsey years ago. In the present case, however, he witnessed a statement that Emily signed regarding her wishes for John to have custody of Chloe. John Sterbick went to John and Emily's apartment and will testify that she was competent and clear with respect to her wishes. Curiously, John Sterbick dated Candacy Zygar for about 4 years, I think shortly after she was out of law school.</p></li>
<li><p>Jeris Underwood. Jeris Underwood is John Sterbick's paralegal. (There is some odd connection between Jeris Underwood and John Dempsey's mother; Underwood was named after her but I do not believe that Underwood knows the Dempsey family.) Jeris signed a declaration regarding her observations of Emily Murphy, and will testify that Emily was competent and clear with respect to wanting John Dempsey to have custody of Chloe.</p></li>
<li><p>Lisa Duke, MSW. I have not had any contact with Lisa Duke, however, she is a counselor at BRIDGES, and observed John, Emily and Chloe together.</p></li>
<li><p>Bethany O'Neill</p></li>
<li><p>Sue M. jSteven</p></li>
<li><p>Vicki McKinlay. Chloe's school counselor</p></li>
<li><p>Michelle Massey. Gilda's Club</p></li>
