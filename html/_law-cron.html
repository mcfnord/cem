<p>Re: Custody of Chloe E. Murphy, Child</p>
<p>Pierce County Superior Court No. 14-3-01631-9</p>
<p>Dear Ms. Burgess:</p>
<p>Thank you for your willingness to serve as guardian ad litem for Chloe Murphy. Chloe is seven. Her mother, Emily Murphy, died of brain cancer on June 1, 2014. I represent John Dempsey, who was Emily's significant other. John has known Chloe since she was almost two years old.</p>
<p>This is a nonparental custody case involving two opposing petitions. John Dempsey filed a petition for custody of Chloe. Kyle Coker is the respondent. He is Chloe's father and <em>pro se</em>. Heather Young represents the intervenors, Richard and Donna Mairs, who are Chloe's maternal step grandfather and grandmother.</p>
<p>Darin Murphy is Chloe's paternal grandfather. He is not a party in the case, but is involved.</p>
<p>Kyle Coker lives in Gainesville, Florida. Mr. Coker's contact information is:</p>
<p>Kyle L. Coker</p>
<p>501 SW 75<sup>th</sup> St, Unit A6</p>
<p>Gainesville, FL 32607</p>
<p>(352) 222-9210</p>
<p>alwayscleanclear@gmail.com</p>
<p>I am forwarding by separate email the pleadings list from LINX, and those the documents from that list which summarize the issues. I have circled the documents which are enclosed.</p>
<p>The following summarizes the facts and legal proceedings:</p>
<p>To the best of my knowledge, Kyle Coker has not seen Chloe since she was an infant. Both he and Emily were in the military and were stationed in California when she became pregnant with Chloe. Mr. Coker moved back home to Florida before Chloe was born. After her birth Emily took Chloe to Florida to see him. They stayed (this is debated) up to 5 days. Mr. Coker owes approximately $13,000 in back child support.</p>
<p>Emily and Chloe moved to Washington, and lived with her stepfather and mother. Emily had known John Dempsey for several years. They began dating when Chloe was not quite two years old. There was a point in their relationship when they did not date, however, John continued to have regular visitation with Chloe and was involved in her life. Both Emily and Chloe spent numerous holidays with John and his extended family.</p>
<p>In or about April of 2013 attorney Mike Howard drafted a will for Emily in which she name her father, Darin Murphy, as executor of her estate and as trustee of a trust for Chloe, and nominated Richard and Donna Mairs as guardian of Chloe. Emily subsequently had brain surgery. Not long after that surgery Emily wished to change her will to substitute John Dempsey as guardian for Chloe. Emily asked John to raise Chloe consistently since the original will was drafted.</p>
<p>Emily contacted Mr. Howard on at least three occasions, indicating that she wished to change her estate plan. It is my understanding that Mr. Howard declined to make any changes to Emily's will unless (1) Emily, John, her father, mother and stepfather met and there was a universal agreement as to who should be guardian or (2) she provided him with a letter from a physician stating that she had the mental and emotional capacity to understand and rationally make a new guardian designation.</p>
<p>John Dempsey and Emily Murphy saw attorney Joyce Robson to petition for John's adoption of Chloe. Kyle Coker consented to the adoption. The maternal grandparents, Darin Murphy and Donna Mairs, were advised of the adoption and raised concerns regarding John's relationship with Chloe. Additionally, adoption attorney Candace Zygar wrote a letter to the adoption investigator, advising against the adoption. It is my understanding that these concerns related to two prior CPS reports, both of the same allegation that Darin Murphy's mother (Emily's paternal grandmother) had witnessed John sexually assault Chloe in Mexico. An investigation yielded no findings of abuse. Nevertheless, the adoption stalled out.</p>
<p>Joyce Robson referred Emily to attorney Brianne Campbell, an estate planning attorney. After interviewing Emily extensively about her mental status, choices, and whether or not she was under duress, Ms. Campbell drafted a codicil to Emily's will. In the codicil, Emily substituted John Dempsey as executor of her estate and trustee of the trust for Chloe. She nominated John, both in the codicil and a power of attorney, as guardian for Chloe.</p>
<p>John Dempsey retained me regarding custody of Chloe.</p>
<p>On April 14, 2014, Emily signed an affidavit, indicating that John has been a key part of Chloe's life since she was an infant, that he was committed to caring for Chloe, and that it was her desire for John to be Chloe's legal guardian.</p>
<p>On April 18th, John signed the Petition for Nonparental Custody.</p>
<p>On April 18th, Emily signed a joinder to the Petition. She also signed a declaration, indicating that John Dempsey is Chloe's father figure, that she calls him &quot;Dad&quot;, and that John is the best person to care for Chloe and that he should, at a minimum, be her legal guardian.</p>
<p>The petition was filed on April 21, 2014.</p>
<p>Emily's condition worsened. Hospice care, which began around March, was increased by a few hours. John continued to be Emily's primary caregiver. This included monitoring/administering medications to Emily, turning her to avoid pressure sores, changing her clothes and linens, and feeding her. During that same time John was also Chloe's primary care provider.</p>
<p>Due to concerns that Emily's condition was worsening, I filed an ex parte motion to obtain an order placing Chloe with John. I spoke with Kyle Coker prior to obtaining the order and, at that point, he did not oppose it. The order was entered on May 8, 2014.</p>
<p>On May 13, 2014, Richard and Donna Mairs filed a motion to intervene. My client did not oppose it. An agreed order of intervention was entered on May 22, 2014.</p>
<p>Emily's condition took a sharp turn for the worse. Since Emily had a full resuscitate health care directive, John could no longer care for her at home. Additionally, John was experiencing what I have now learned is &quot;caregiver collapse&quot;. He was becoming increasingly fatigued and having difficulty coping.</p>
<p>On Thursday, May 15th, Emily was moved from the apartment she shared with John and Chloe to her father's home. Darin Murphy had power of attorney for Emily's health care.</p>
<p>The following Monday, May 19th, CPS picked up Chloe from school and with Kyle Coker's consent placed her in Donna Mairs' care. Based on what has been disclosed to date, CPS had received calls from two of the Hospice workers regarding John's ability to care for Chloe. This included concern that he was allowing Chloe to be undressed around strangers, that he took a shower without closing the bathroom door and that he was mentally unstable due to caregiver collapse. Statements from those Hospice employees were part of the pleadings emailed to you. (One of these Hospice workers has never met Chloe.)</p>
<p>At CPS' request John met with caseworker Camille Johnston the following morning, who advised him of concerns that he was grooming Chloe and was mentally unstable, and that Kyle Coker was exercising his parental rights. With the exception of John dropping off Chloe's personal effects at CPS, CPS has had no further contact with John. CPS has not contacted John's family or friends.</p>
<p>On May 23, 2014, Richard and Donna Mairs filed a motion to restrain John Dempsey from disturbing their peace, from having any contact with Chloe, to prevent both John and Kyle Coker from removing Chloe from Washington, and to allow Mr. Coker's time with Chloe to be agreed between the Mairs and him. Mr. Coker joined in the motion.</p>
<p>At some point in time Emily's family changed her health care directive from full resuscitation to do not resuscitate.</p>
<p>On June 1, 2014, Emily passed away.</p>
<p>On June 10th, Commissioner Clint Johnson entered an agreed order continuing the adequate cause hearing on John's petition to July 7.</p>
<p>On June 11, 2014, Commissioner Clint Johnson heard the Mairs' motion for temporary orders, and entered a Temporary Custody Order placing temporary custody of Chloe with the Mairs, and providing twice weekly supervised visitation with John. If supervision is provided by a professional supervisor, Commissioner Johnson ordered that the cost be split between the Mairs and John. Visitation is to take place &quot;in the community.&quot; Kyle Coker did not appear.</p>
<p>My client was eager for visitation to start because, at that point in time, he had not seen Chloe since May 19th. Additionally Emily had passed away and John was worried about Chloe.</p>
<p>Immediately following the June 11th hearing my client proposed that some of his family members as well as Donna Mairs' sister serve as supervisor. These suggestions were turned down. Ms. Mairs' sister declined. Donna Mairs suggested that one of her neighbors be supervisor, but John turned that down because he did not know her.</p>
<p>The parties agreed to have someone from Community Family Services be visitation supervisor. These are mandatory reporters. A person named Charlotte from CFS has now provided supervision for 8 visits between John and Chloe. In order to provide as much transparency as possible, John has incurred the expense of having Charlotte provide a written report of each visit.</p>
<p>At the adequate cause hearing on July 7th, Commissioner Johnson entered orders granting adequate cause. He also entered an order with a GAL strike list and directing each party to pay $375 toward the GAL's fee, and a scope order regarding the GAL's investigation. The scope includes the parenting abilities of all parties, the alleged physical/sexual abuse of Chloe by John, and any abandonment/neglect by Mr. Coker.</p>
<p>Mr. Coker appeared by phone. Mr. Coker indicated that he has been in contact with Darin Murphy and is making arrangements to come out in August to see Chloe.</p>
<p>Kyle Coker filed a response to the petitions, indicating that he wants custody of Chloe.</p>
<p>Visitations continued.</p>
<p>During the July 13th visit, Chloe commented about a video that John had taken of her. Here is the precise language from the report:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We returned to the house and Mr. Dempsey and Chloe made cooked mushrooms and corn on the cob. Chloe wanted to video their cooking and food selection. Chloe videoed herself talking about the food and singing. While Chloe was videoing herself commentating, Chloe addressed Mr. Dempsey as John then her dad. She stopped hesitated then said yes my dad. Chloe and Mr. Dempsey sang a theme song to the move Frozen, &quot;Let it go.&quot; While sitting at the table eating, Chloe mentioned to Mr. Dempsey you should post our video on the internet to see how many subscribers we get. Then Chloe said to Mr. Dempsey, &quot;Remember when you videoed me getting dressed? You kept telling me to get dressed and I said no.&quot; Mr. Dempsey shook his head in acknowledgement. Chloe then said, &quot;You should put that on the internet to see how many subscribers we get.&quot; Mr. Dempsey said he would not. Chloe asked if he had put the video on the internet. Mr. Dempsey said no, adding that it was on his computer and that he would keep it for her. Mr. Dempsey said he could put it on a memory stick for her. Chloe asked what a memory stick was and Mr. Dempsey explained to her how they work.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chloe has been in counseling with Katy Johnson, MA PhD since June of this year. Donna Mairs showed the July 13th report to Katy Johnson. My client never has had any contact with Katy Johnson.</p>
<p>On July 25th, Donna Mairs filed a motion in the ex parte department to terminate John's contact with Chloe and to enter a restraining order against him. Ms. Mairs submitted a declaration from Katy Johnson indicating that Donna Mairs had &quot;apprised [her] of the ongoing litigation related to custody of Chloe including the concerns about Mr. Dempsey's relationship with Chloe. Donna Mairs, in the counselor's presence, discussed the video with Chloe, who apparently said that a friend of John's videotaped her while she was getting dressed and that she was wearing her underwear. The counselor could not recall the name of the friend. Without having seen the video or even asked to see it, Katy Johnson recommended that John's contact with Chloe terminate immediately pending further information.</p>
<p>Donna Mairs filed a declaration alleging that Chloe had indicated that my client's friend, Harry, made the video. After the counseling session, it appears that Ms. Mairs continued to discuss the video with Chloe.</p>
<p>As stated in Ms. Mairs' declaration, Chloe &quot;...disclosed that Mr. Dempsey would play games with her while she was getting dressed and while Mr. Dempsey's friend made a video. Chloe reports that they would throw clothes back and forth. Again, these &quot;games&quot; are taking place while Chloe is at least partially undressed and being videotaped.&quot;</p>
<p>Donna Mairs has not seen the video nor asked to see it.</p>
<p>At the July 25th hearing, both Commissioner Kirkendoll and Heather Young declined to view the video. In an attempt to protect both my client and Chloe Commissioner Kirkendoll entered an order suspending John's contact with Chloe. Commissioner Kirkendoll noted that she was not familiar with the case, and set the matter for hearing before Commissioner Johnson on August 5th. She also appointed you as GAL.</p>
<p>Due to the short notice of the motion, I only had time to file a declaration from my client. I will be filing a supplemental declaration from John and a declaration from Harry Silva denying the allegations that anything untoward happened. Mr. Silva will specifically deny that he has videotaped Chloe dressing or undressing or that he has seen such videos of her.</p>
<p>Kyle Coker did not pay his share of the GAL fee, so my client paid it in order to move the case along.</p>
<p>I will provide you with a copy of the video.</p>
<p>My client believes that it is in Chloe's best interest to resume visitation as soon as possible. This will be addressed at the August 5th hearing. If you need additional information please let me know.</p>
<p>If you have questions about the probate case, please let me know. I am sure that Eileen Peterson would be willing to answer questions.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>COUNSELL, MURPHY &amp; COX, P.S.</p>
