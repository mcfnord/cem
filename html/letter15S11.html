<p>This is from Melissa's wedding. I remember attending. I saw Emily there after many years of not seeing her. I saw her tattoo and asked who Chloe is. You were at that wedding, but I didn't meet you there. We didn't meet until <a href="y1xS3.html">you and Emily joined me in Mexico</a>, a week later. You grabbed onto my head and said, &quot;There you are!&quot;</p>

<p>Emily kept this photo on her phone for a long time.</p>

<p>We loved camping. Twice we went to the Metow River to raft there. I brought my hammock. You got to roam around the forest campout area. (I kept an eye on you every second, because the river could really sweep a child away!) Em went rafting in a wetsuit. It's a wild river.</p>
