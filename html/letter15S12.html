<p>This is a famous painting called <em>The Starry Night</em>, by Vincent van Gogh. We're at the Museum of Modern Art, in Manhattan. They wouldn't let kids ride on shoulders so we had to carry you through the whole museum. But that was fine.</p>

<p>Emily's birthday. I guess that's her last birthday. That's at Aunt Melissa's house. I think she took the picture.</p>

<p>My family took you both to the Nutcracker while I moved my things to Tacoma. Donna made a fuss because she preferred you attend church that day. I'm glad Emily came to the performance. Perhaps some people value exceptional seasonal dance musical theater, and some people believe regular church attendance is more valuable. There are many kinds of people in the world.</p>

<p>Freda Everdell, who is Paula's mom, who was always there on 4th of July when we camped in Longbeach, knew what Emily wanted for you, and she stood with Emily. Paula is next to you and Emily in this picture.</p>
