<p>Chloe, you were her top priority. She endured much for you, happily. You made her smile. She noticed you're a cool person early on. She said, &quot;Everyone says their kid is cool, but mine really is. I really feel lucky to know her.&quot; I feel the same way.</p>

<p>Emily laughed so much. It's hard to find a picture where she isn't smiling. She joked around a lot, too. She and I shared a wild and goofy sense of humor.</p>
