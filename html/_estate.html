<p><strong>Donna:</strong> Rural Metro which is an ambulance company here in town. The date is May 14 , 2014 which is the day Emily was taken out of the apartment and went to darin's. I don't think the company ever got the info about her insurance,</p>
<p>Jason Dempsey, Paula Everdell, Jeanine Dempsey, Jim Dempsey, Curtis Brown. All on this list have no criminal record. Nearly half are retired public school teachers in Pierce County schools. All are people known to Chloe, who Chloe routinely asks to see. Donna Mairs has prohibited all from attending visits, asked over 10 times, allowing only two exceptions so far.</p>
<p>My property in Seattle is adjacent to Seattle Prepatory Academy</p>
<p>carlos has instructed me to get $100k in life insurance, naming chloe as benefactor. and to revise my will to specify a trust.</p>

<p>Testimony to the Superior Court: As you know, Emily and I applied to an expressive arts school and a Montessori one, but Donna discarded these options . Chloe is naturally expressive, and smart to a degree that is noteworthy. I own a home in Seattle that is next to a challenging private Jesuit-run junior high school (Seattle Prep). These are dreams Emily and I shared for Chloe. I never missed an open house, including pre-school. I taught Chloe how to multiply and divide. This goes back to a conversation I had with Emily about how girls peak in math at 4th grade. Emily asked me to assure that Chloe would not let gender pressures overwhelm her interest in the sciences. After the summer, she reports now that she doesn't remember division. I speak a language in play with her that we have evolved over her life. We are loyal to each other and Emily. I hope in the future to be accepted by Chloe's biological family as I was for 26 years, but it's not a critical goal. I also hope to continue very actively in Chloe's life.</p>

<p>I NEED TO EXTRACT EVERY LJ POST THAT IS MORE RECENT THAN THIS CUTOFF DATE: 2011-10-07 16:34: 50 I GOT THE STUFF BEFORE THAT.</p>
<p>Darin prohibited Pat herb from internment</p>
<p>PATRICIA PUT THIS IN YOUR TESTIMONY. i should publish this into the Witness file. CS, I want to hype this deposition. I know I can show up like I never saw her before... I can do that... But... What I like to do is dialogue ridiculously. Call it what you will, it is my view: I feel like it's hard for me to understand how I can answer the questions of such an unscrupulous person. Yuna said that she wished to burn sage to cleans after Heather spoke. I'm more afflicted with knowing a ridiculous wench lied through her teeth to set me up, saying 4 of 5, capable of... I'd like to know if she's feeling better. I'd like to ask about her lies, the ones I watched her tell. You know?</p>
<p>I NEED TO EXTRACT EVERY LJ POST THAT IS MORE RECENT THAN THIS CUTOFF DATE: 2011-10-07 16:34:50 I GOT THE STUFF BEFORE THAT. MAP IN EXCEL LIKE THIS: how can i build out a calendar? 2011-08-20 23:24:42, chloe was present, as per photo to LJ A draft of a letter to Susan Kennedy is in writing!!!!!! CARLOS NEEDS A 2013 TIMELINE with bullet points with exict and inexact dates Carlos, I speculate the attachment from the prosecutor would boil down to some confirmation that Chloe, if she has a legal father, gets whatever fathers provide instead of the state. If she remains with the mairs, which is likely, then they would establish medical insurance.</p>
<p>OK, the military dependents medical insurance she is entitled to receive could be strong. I do not know. If it's strong, why is she taking the dshs medical? Why can't she be placed on military medical now as provided by the DoD? The educational benefits available to her through the military are lavish. She did not ride her bike this summer. Susan Kennedy would flip to learn that. Instead she played Xbox with the uncle and aunt who Donna would like to take Chloe when Donna and Richard die. No real news I guess. J In 2012 Darin visited me twice in Seattle with his new wife and kids, one also with Alexandria, Asked me to come to Tacoma and be her last boyfriend.</p>
<p>Joyce knows Heather called Kyle and said I'm a child molester early on. c:is PDFs worth spit.</p>
<p>You cannot take the wierd out of John Dempsey. Make peace with it and assure me you'll let John Dempsey have his own speech trial, outrageous in so many ways. I am, to myself and some others, an artist of events. Words, sure. These are events. I must be true to myself, and my game. In the end I am much more Elonis than you would wish. That surley rogue had bad judgement and a point: it's not a right if you don't claim it. I have a life history of controversial speech, but never violence, nor the threat of it. The threat of violence is a failure to tters, and I doubt you'll want to share them. AND I think the videos we just delivered might make Susan re-evaluate the importance of those year-by-year timelines and scenarios. Asking how I felt toward Emily is only marginally relevant to the de facto matter. No, other than being duely and truly adorned with her blessings, my relationship with Emily is not germane to the court's decision. I'm sure Emily would see it as a sideshow, and what part of evaluating me places a stress test on those details?</p>
<p>Susan asked if I left Emily while she was dying, early in 2012 it might have been. I explained that I did not, but instead confirmed face-to-face with the doctor that she was not actively dying. I think Susan would have a point there: If you'd leave her when she's dying, you're probably a creep.</p>
<div id="vicky-mariah">
<ul>
<li>Vicky McKinlay, a woman who knows Chloe well, said to me once, &quot;I've been supoenaed before,&quot; She certainly knew Chloe, but how well could she know me? Other than the many positive things she said to me. She said at some point after Donna visited here, &quot;Where is the GAL? This case needs a GAL.&quot; And now there is one... perhaps we can even rely on the fact that Susan has Vicky's cellular number. Vicky is not some urgent mega-witness. I think she's very ambivalent about getting into these legal settings. I worry that she'd say that I was showing signs of stress, which I was. But she, at one point, shared that she would speak positively to changes in Chloe since residing with me. That quote is worth... how much... in this matter? Minor if we're just going for (a) I'm not an evil child ogre, and (b) Pierce County isn't doing more than unsupervised visits in my home every few days.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mariah is a care-giver with Advanced Health Care. She'd be a fine witness of Darin's behavior, which she heavily monitored and criticized. I know at this point we need physical witnesses, but I think Mariah loved Emily and me and saw some bullshit that probably stands out in her mind to this day.</p>
</div>
<p>I am committed to keeping Chloe in Donna's life and i am able to coordinate with the extended family to keep Chloe connected to the people who loved Emily. In practical terms this means car trips, bus stop meetups, phone calls, adherance to fair rules, as ruled by the court. I have done this consistently with the entire family for six years with Chloe and that would continue.</p>
<div id="manning">
<p>I can't think of an uncool Manning, for example. Richard Mairs is cool. I want to like Donna, and used to like her, but now I kind of don't like her. I certainly don't show it to Chloe, and never have. I can name all Emily's aunts an uncles, nieces and nephews. Chloe also knows mine.</p>
</div>
<p>===</p>
<p>I TELL KENNEDY Shit that fucking matters: The registered Nurse Assistant did not say Chloe was naked in my lap.</p>
<p>Mead is the new Therapist at Hope Sparks.</p>
<p>Unlimited postcards. order authorizes swimming order authorizes visiting my home in SeaTac order authorizing chloe sitting on my damn lap ORDER DAY TRIPS TO SEATTLE order authorizes telephone calls, even recorded telephone calls.</p>
<p>Donna wrote many times to explicitly reject adults in my family. Her pattern of doing so is available in writing.</p>
<p>so that donna is not empowered to block people. Explicit authorization of the court to allow these adults in my family who are known to Chloe.</p>
<ul>
<li>No supervision. Alternatively, supervision by this list of parties approved by the court: Herb Dempsey, Jeris Ockfen, Howard Dempsey, Jan Dempsey, Jason Dempsey, Paula Everdell, Jeanine Dempsey, Jim Dempsey, Curtis Brown. All on this list have no criminal record. Nearly half are retired public school teachers in Pierce County schools. All are people known to Chloe, who Chloe routinely asks to see. Donna Mairs has prohibited all from attending visits, asked over 10 times, allowing only two exceptions so far. Take this power from Donna Mairs and vest it in the court where wisdom can prevail over fear. * I want both money and time that is reserved. Recover all reserved hours. Ex parte loss and other loss and Most recent documented losses.</li>
</ul>
<p>Prohibit Chloe from being at Darin's house so long as it contains unsecured weapons. <em>This is useful for matters with Joni Irvin who approvehigh-quality secondary school education while residing in an environment where children enjoy a much higher standard of living. This is exactly what Emily wanted. Emily saw the deep connection Chloe shared with me, and she saw the value I held as a strong parental figure. Chloe deserves the best childhood her substantial resources can afford her, and I am best suited to provide and administer that life, based on the strong relationship we maintain, my existing resources and skills, my continued committment to her betterment, and my humanistic, scientific parenting training. Document cabin. Well it should be understood... but it's the future. My own custody, vs. Donna Mairs, presents serious differences for Chloe, her opportunities, and her enrichment. One fact I've been ignoring: the docs of the third cps case are now available from cps. Tracy postponed to April because that third report would not be available til April. I know origins and details of it, but does that info help decide what, if anything, we should do? Do we need to get it in case the other parties want it or something? Could the g.a.l. fetch it? Cuz I don't care. I have intake paperwork for the new supervisor. WHERE IS THAT? IT HAS CONTACT INFO, ETC. where is that? i might have completed it, or might not. i think i need to follow up with jaqulin Donna has severe diabetes and Emily explained Donna doesn't do the exercise and diet necessary to prevent serious fatigue. Can I do my writing task without a faster computer? Yes? Then i needn't think of that more. I am here for the story... v3... starring all stars they call witnesses. as accurately as possible. that is one sequence of events. and carlos wants that sequence. and to know those players. 0) our witnesses: lengthy conversations with all friends and family, about what choice to make. 1) called kickman 2) called joni 3) candace jumped in 4) 2nd meeting 5) letter from joni 2) Import all emails... review Emily's emails I guess. I guess my own email shows details about events. and hers might also. certainly. BUT WE CARE ABOUT EVENTS WITH WITNESSES IN THEM. THEIR WITNESSES. which means two women.their professional witnesses. == NOW You have asked me for a number of documents, old and new. Here's the forever link to my background writing: http://tucc.us/background.docx Can I send that letter in there to Michael Howard? In that Background, I point out Fact Errors in the GAL Preliminary Report. I want to publish this to the new G.A.L. You don't need to think too hard about Joni Irvin. She didn't like me, she had some dig on me, like I'm FREAKING THE FUCK OUT AT BEING THE VICTIM OF AN INSANE PLOT. Prior to meeting the Murphy Monsoon, she was very supportive. Anyway, don't think too hard about her. Give her evidence and she goes away. But what an experience, madness, sadness, insanity. An insanely hostile explosion, planned and executed daily as she faded. AS SHE FADED. I am a forgiving guy, ultimately, but that's some fucked up shit. And not an inch of it may darken our souls with its shadow. This hearing was fun. He spoke of True Threats and not knowing Elonis, he was bested with unusually salient retort. Tell Patrick Cooper he is going through the motions, and it's probably great, but he needs to get to the point. Don't show up to argue feebly; we are way ahead. This poor guy. But tell him I still have no mercy for him, if he shows up to argue my case that feebly. It has been an... honor? no. but a treasure. it has been a treasure to be so connected to history as to be saved by SCOTUS in such dramatic fashion. One evening, I learned that Emily was maybe 24 hours from losing her medical insurance. Moving around, being the subjects of disruptive techniques from underhanded to haunting, her debit card got lost. She replaced it, we moved a few addresses, we didn't get the notice or any paper mail... and one day--ONE DAY, Carlos--I say to Emily, &quot;Now is the day when I take all the paper mail, this bill, and just make sure it's right.&quot; And she handed it to me. And it was THAT notice, saying a loss of medical insurance was... the paper having passed around in piles in Donna's house... and eventually reaching me... less than 2 days from losing all military medical benefits. I am not a clumsy or dumb guy. I ultimately prepared a more stable cash flow plan for her, automating all financials between and for us both, but I nearly missed, by a day, a catastrophe. This happened like this, with magic, over and over again with us 3. Not just luck but magical luck. And we should make some of that now, to make Patrick switch sides, as soon as possible. If it's not possible, we aren't going to spend a lot of time playing with him. AND I WANT TO WRITE MORE STATEMENTS AND STUFF. I'm gathering these: </em> Pictures of my apartment, interior and exterior Pics of two friends with Chloe at Pt. Defiance: I have this hard copy. Scan? === SOSA WANTS! === FYI The personal representative has the authority to make most decisions on his or her own, but must carefully consider fiduciary duties in making each decision because the personal representative is ultimately answerable for that decision. A part of me wants to seek a speedy trial so I can close the Estate of Emily Rose Murphy. GET THE SHIT FROM THAT OTHER FUCKER. ALECE WILL ADVISE. Could you, on my behalf, chide the prosecutor for not yet deciding if he wants to involve the judge? == When you want to talk about &quot;The Failed Adoption,&quot; remember: [Jan Dempsey decl] Response to Murphy Dep: His huge lie is that I kept the adoption a secret. Only Mariela and Melissa know the truth. He also downplays our activities over the years. We went skiing once. He showed me how to sneak in to the Nordstrom cafeteria. He came to Seattle to top two trees for me. It's correct that we didn't go camping, but I invited him camping with Emily and me twice. Draft of Factual Errors in Preliminary Gal Report should be hosted in Background.docx Emails to bettina. Well she's a scatterbrain. She sounds ridiculous. Log in to Emily's OneDrive secret: e.r.m@hm.c pw EmJohnChloe3 PRINT HER PHOTOS. https://onedrive.live.com/?qt=allmyphotos&amp;v=photos i want to show emily's photos on emily's onedrive, as curated by emily. it's one of her &quot;logs&quot; in v1 i'm just going to list these sources for heather. can i ask donna to respond to specific photographs? http://tucc.us/voicemails_emily.mp3 IF I COULD YOUTUBE THESE, I COULD EMBED LINKS TO SPECIFIC MESSAGES which accompany dates? needing the date is kind of a pisser. http://tucc.us/voicemails_chloe.mp3 http://tucc.us/voicemails_sundry.mp3 1. Darin Darin's critical voicemail is at xx:xx. I THINK I JUST PUBLISHED ONE TO RULE THEM ALL? TAKE AL OOK. THAT COULD BE MY SINGLE YOUTUBE URL WITH PRESET POINTS... but confirm it's everyhon.e I could very easily publish as one mp3 on youtube, and give markers to every party... darin, donna, chloe, emily, melissa, other. yeah, i'm trying this i guess. == I'M DOING ONE THING c:_to_sosa_chloe.mp3 Thirty Minutes of Chloe addressing Dad, often with encouragement and assistance from Mom yeah, sure, just pop pics on it. fine but i can't even do that... just publish as mp3? publish as the last slideshow... that means putting an mp3 onto a video. YOUTUBE IS GOING TO WORK. WHEREAS OUR SHIT... WELL... find that editor OK FUCK THAT WE'RE GOING WITH MP3 NOW. ok, make an emily one, then make a rest of people one. AND YOUTUBE LETS ME REFER TO ANY POINT. SO IT MUST BE ON YOUTUBE AS AUDIO so try that one with chloe again. MOVIE MAKER IS CRYING MAYBE IT WANTS A REBOOT. I can just publish the mp3 although i can't refer to a precise point in it.</p>
<p>prints into 11x17 of all docs, OK A SKYDRIVE DOCX FILE EXISTS... EMAILED TO MYSELF. so print. c:SAY crude computer-authored transcripts also exist. publish that unpublished to youtube. bunch them sensibly and publish! yes, that alone is adequate. screw transcripts. i can publish this tonight! combine mp3s with her photos. from the existing curated... c:_for_sosa hmm, but nothing already published... which was... or create another voicemails with pics slide show. Skim for these. Everyone <em>other than Emily</em> or anything beyond Emily's place in my life. ok, a photo review. shouldn't be too tough. OF ME AT PARTIES. Look on facebook with and etc. obviously must pull from darinmurphy.com and other sources. YEAH GOTTA DO IT SOMEHOW. It's pics for Sosa. Yes I'd like to read all those people's delcarations. It would be a great time investment. And painful. mariela's are perhaps the ones that makes mose sense. FILES THAT I WANT CARLOS TO GET SOON CAN BE ATTACHMENTS IF STATIC so texts.xxx should be an attachment and not a live doc? witnesses.docx is a live doc. AND THIS IS SO BECAUSE... Carlos needs to know about these people. AND IF THEY'RE DEPOSED SOON, HE NEEDS TO KNOW SOON. well witnesses is our witnesses. Review LJ for additional Background content. Docs and summaries, in an email he can save for later. And writing, as tempting as it is, goes to sosa_doc yeah, right click the All mail Incl...mbox, search or something, Search Messages. I think. Let's try. C: publish these files cleanly. WAIT IT STRIPS OFF THE ATTACHMENT INTO THE FILE SYSTEM. FROM THAT SEARCH OR WHATEVER IT WAS. but can it neatly print? THAT FEATURE WOULD BE A SINGLE STEP STRIP. I COULD SELECT EVERY ATTACHMENT I want you to write to Peter Beckwith, Legal Advisor, who works at South Sound 911, or for it, precisely at Darin's office: Mr. Beckwith, On the last page of your FILE COPY, dated March 20th, 2015, I see a sentence: &quot;Thought that you might want to be aware of this, not sure what if any action could or should be taken.&quot; Following this sentence is the name Darin, and two telephone numbers. In this correspondence, Darin clearly writes to someone (&quot;Thought that you...&quot;). Darin can't decide if anything at all should be done. Does Darin have a last name? This email's metadata--datestamp, recipient, subject, sender--CAN AND SHOULD be released to me. Many Regards, John Dempsey At very least would such a step be consistent with the good will I have earned with this court through over 150 pages and 200 hours of supervised visit reporting evidence? do we need an annointable, comprehensive document of visit reporting? yes, because that story needs consumption. it's persuasive. Maybe it's important that it seems like this plan isn't coming from me/us. I doubt it will be easy to get them to do the right thing. That's why I think the fear of losing both the money and the girl is our best bet. Fear and greed are things they comprehend. &quot;Doing the right thing&quot; is quite secondary. &quot;You will lose absolutely everything&quot; is the message that works with them. REMEMBER: I NEED A RELIABLE WAY TO SIFT <em>SENT ITEMS</em> still fishing. never made up my mind if that file viewer was working. i might trash thunderbird and try again. file:///C:/temp/git_lj/posts-xml/2013-05.xml YES I CAN USE INTERNET EXPLORER TO SHRINK AWAY ENTRIES. if i can use firefox, i'm very sold. great publishing strategy. How many html files? sort of like 73. maybe 20 beefy ones. well i'd see more on mr. 30 perahps Source Insight will make sifting LJ practical. or visual studio. indenting and closies or easy selection... INDENTIES PRETTY VALUABLE. and Source Insight didn't seem to indent... maybe it's a setting. Ok, I can deliver LiveJournal about E&amp;C by keyword search, probably. ok, publishing lj about them is a green light. http://www.freeviewer.org/mbox/ if their Convert to PDF hmmm, only Adobe PDF Setting on EXPENSIVE one. If I parse out mbox... hey, thunderbird, how come you never revealed any sent mail to me? worth importing again just to see if it can be imported. i still face the problem of all to and all from particular parties. printed. i need that data printed. in sequence. EVEN THOUGH THIS APP APPEARED TO CHOKE AND DIE, PERHAPS ITS PRETTY PDF PRINTING FEATURE, AN EXPENSIVE FEATURE, WILL SOLVE MY APP PROBLEM. YES THERE ARE SENT EMAILS IN THE MBOX FILE BUT I DON'T SEE THEM ON THUNDERBIRD so i'm trying this viewer download app. and if it blows, i will re-import the new mbox into a CLEAN thunderbird i am not enthused about parsing mbox files using roll-my-own code to find emails i need to view my GMAIL SENT. don't see it in mbox file. A big mbox file. that's why i got the thunderbird. can i filter in thunderbird? to and from cfs? to cfs doesn't appear in this thunderbird. maybe re-load. after i see what this viewer can do. if it's just from 2014... thjat missses just a bit. c:_junkpile.docx is a lot of &quot;vignette&quot; source material. c:.docx paste of stuff i want to show him. STATIC DOCUMENTS OTHERWISE GO TO C:_TO_SOSA, including ./pics C:-20150409T005959Z-3.zip lots to work into there...!!! Voice WHICH INCLUDES TRANSCRIPTS, WHICH ARE EXPLICITLY REQUESTED BY HEATHER and we are going to mega-publish one dataset of the transcripts, then target numbers Pictures (one of two sets for this takeout) Voicemails with transcripts by speaker, but a variety of from numbers. i can start with any and every voicemail i have already downloaded. right? did i download them all and screen them all? voicemails from target phone numbers. Voicemails from Donna Ok, so sequential, with transcripts... and an easy removal interface. at minimum simple YouTube Audio now. Takeout of Google Photos folder suggests I must flatten, quickly scan for evidence, all my Google-tracked and what about facebook-tracked? there are fewer. and twitter-tracked... those are just smaller streams. COMPENDIUMS ARE LARGER STREAMS AND WILL DUPLICATE THESE. and frankly compendiums are an easier task to prove the same point, so raid compendiums first. === GREAT RESULTS FROM GOOGLE TAKEOUT EMAIL MIGHT BE BETTER SERVED BY THE THUNDERBIRD, WEB, OR MAIL INTERFACES, RATHER THAN GOOGLE TAKEOUT. c:_to_sosa well it has some alece docs... does it have all we know of!? Alece... all attachments... possible? yeah, probably just strip down to no apps, open each document, and save what i think i want to sosa'ize. one pass. yay. A LIST OF IDENTITIES TO QUERY. DOES WEB INTERFACE BULK-DOWNLOAD ATTACHMENTs? i want all her attachments... I HAVE TO ENUMERATE THE SPECIFIC ATTACHMENTS I AM AWARE OF, BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE IF THIS EXTRACTOR GETS ALL THE ATTACHMENTS! . IF IT'S IN THE CASE, I DON'T NEED IT HERE. ok, first gmail chunk: All attachments of Alece Cox. Just 71 contain attachments? something's fishy. it crashes. I want to ask Donna why she rejected every single adult, on every single day of request. That takes all email to and from CFS. ok, want to interleave all to-from with CFS so I get chronological. eml files don't have datestamps. data extract from google takeout, let's hope you help here. . Seems like a simple data filter. Howard Dempsey. Herb Dempsey. Jeris. Etc. Every rejection, dates. Grandma says no Seattle. Fear. Grandma afraid of Howard. OVERRULE GRANDMA - grandma fearing Howard is an Exhibit please gET THAT description of that interaction with murphy written by dad. ALL ATTACHMENTS FROM DAD, PLUS CAREFUL CURATION. YES, EVERY ATTACHMENT FROM ALECE EVER ONE... IS... MISSING... I THOUGHT OF IT LAST NIGHT... BUT FORGOT! do a google data extract? or do a thunderbird file-by-file review? or searches? well i can search easiest in thunderbird. i think. let's play with that google gmail extract again. ok, let's. Emails to-from Darin Emails from Alece</p>
<p>EVEN JUST THE QUESTIONS ready to read. SO THAT'S A BAR I CAN DO GRIND THROUGH. using the same script as in the g.a.l. answers c:.docx is a LIFE DOC CARLOS CAN VIEW. it's where talk about their witnesses, and perahps my own. http://tucc.us/xx/witnesses.docx DIDN'T WORK. - yeah i think it worked. this is a living doc. Sosa investigator could appraoch Dina, spend a good long time with her, and shake her down for documents, including Sealed C. cluster by individual, emily, donna, richard, darin, bettina?, darryl? Even Chloe can be played during the depositions, or transcripts of her. Let them hear her say dad as many times as possible.

<p>He observed me for 6, and read every document in this whole messy case so far. Maybe you think I'm a thug forcing Emily to sign papers. Maybe you think I sneeze wrong. None of that adds up to your view that I could only see Chloe under supervision, me, never charged with any crime, smeared liberally through false reports to CPS and APS, 4 cases opened and closed. You should read those case details. You would know more as an expert if you did. See how Darin fought for the half million, spitefully, dishonestly, all the while smiling and winking like we're friends. You should have serious concerns about having placed children in his care, after what I've seen him do to children both physically and psychologically. Or perhaps you think I'm lying? So the trial hinges on whether Emily was wrong, over 5 years, in the presence of career educators, closely observing us together. Donna let this guy in the house as a guest. Her daughter Sara let another sex offender into her house, and that guy sexually assaulted Ally, and Ally sexually assaulted Chloe. Donna plans to move Chloe to Sara's house, a plan made behind Tracy's back. And you come to the conclusion that I should not be with Chloe without supervision? Your conclusion asserts that for 5 years, Emily was wrong about me. Why did you come to it? Darin came to you with a litany of terrible claims about me. My claims about him are rooted in clear facts: He worked with Kyle in an attempt to defeat me in the custody case, offering his home to Kyle. Kyle called Chloe on the telephone, saying he'd like to meet her. When I agreed to the GAL-P's course to put Emily's insurance money in professional hands, Darin countered with an alternative fund manager who happens to sleep with the original, sleazy attorney. When we rejected that, Darin stopped coming to hearings, and Kyle disappeared completely. Pow, down goes Chloe's heart. You think Darin is an honest source of anything? Donna shows the poor boundary control typical of abusive families. Darin shows extreme domineering behaviors, and you've seen them first-hand. There are reasons I came to Tacoma! There are reasons Emily wanted Chloe to be with me, rather than with them. Saying I should be supervised, and saying you &quot;guess&quot; Donna is the best choice for Chloe, goes against five years of Emily's observations and sound decision-making, and goes against the evaluations of my family, the people who spent the most time with us 3. I don't see how you could learn much from the outrageously domineering antics of Darin at that meeting. I remember when you came to my house. You didn't stay long. Emily routinely said Donna lacks self-respect. Is that the role model you have in mind for Chloe? Have you met Richard Mairs? This is the first year in her life where, from her birthday, to Thanksgiving, to Christmas Eve, to New Year's, not only was she not with me, but she was not with my entire family. Look back with me, through a few links to remember moments and milestones. - The ez publish link only of all appropriate vids. well we have a Chloe Playlist that is unlisted. Link to playlist of Chloe videos featuring us 3. It has deeply changed both my life and Chloe's, and both she and I resent what you've said. I haven't told her, but she has said in innumerable testimonies that she wants to see me regularly, and freely. She continues to have both trust and a sense of loyalty to me that I share toward her as well. How could anyone call this relationship anything but tenacious and fantastic? In that vein, I've prepared a publication for Chloe. Please let me know if you like it. Let me know if you think maybe I'm fantastic. I've done much for her and won't stop. I've been given compelling defense by an expert in sexually sick men, that I'm not one. I hope you continue choosing your activities based on your clearest view of me available. It was incredibly hard to do what I did. I embraced the unknown and stood with them both as long as I could, without apology. I did so partially, but only partially, because I know Donna Mairs very well. I did so fully with my whole heart and life, and continue paying whatever price, to grant Emily her wishes, and Chloe hers, every day I am by their side. You have heard a lot of strange things about me... and you need to fully evaluate what they actually mean. So I've prepared a gallery of precise information, chosen for breadth and each chosen just for you, Joni, so you might know more about me. Indeed, this is the most comprehensive presentation of digital information about Chloe and John. Joni, let me tell you a story: In October, 2013, Chloe asked me, &quot;Ok, Write me a story... you know how you make stories of Sparkles the Pink Pony? Make a story called, 'Chloe and John's future together.' Everything I've done since has been preparing that story. And this is, for you, that story, for you are the person who can end it. If you want to watch any part of it, please watch it all the way through, and you will know my decency as Chloe and Emily did. Joni, I don't want to show you a well-chosen presentation. I want you to see how long I've been there in Chloe's life, by including every instance documented of our time together, comprehensively provided by oath: You look, you see, you feel what I felt and feel. I've given real life because I have long ago been her father, showed by this evidence. I believe it is the best evidence ever gathered to tell this story in honest terms, incontrovertable terms, and comprehensively. Because I indeed risk losing an obvious love. What letter would I write to avoid that? A well-documented one. This letter. JUST A SINGLE CHRONOLOGICAL LJ FRONT PAGE. YES, COBBLE EXISTING MCFNORD INTO CLEAR CHLOE COBBLE THEN MY TUMBLR IN OR PUBLISH THIS ON TUMBLR IT'S GREAT PASTE GREAT and show every photo, in a comprehensive way and every video, every dance, every sentence starting at the earliest. IF I USE MY RESOURCES LIKE THIS I WIN. IF I PAY SOMEONE TO DO IT EVEN BETTER. emotionally, i wnat to shut the gate a lot. and next discipline is firing fire. every, comprehensive, beautiful. hijoni.tumblr.com YES I WANT MY ONLINE TIME TO BE PURE DISCIPLINE ON THE ABSOLUTELY MOST IMPORTANT OBJECTIVE I'd like to publish the Chloe story first, just scan it and send to a writer. Then a publisher. so if I go online, pick a writer, send the story. It will be the animation first. But then send all the visit reports. Engage in a dialogue with all of these people. But send three visit reports. I know I didn't say much about myself on your intake papers, and I'm sure you'll agree we had a poor introduction. The only remedy I can think of is a comprehensive dump of my chronicled life and times with chloe, including every word written, picture taken, video made, in roughly chronological order. If I took some out, that's editorializing. Instead, I'm comprehensive. I don't think there are any videos, pictures, and words about Chloe by me that aren't in this set. The court will evaluate how strongly Emily decided, and for what very sound reasoning. I know that's not something you could evaluate about us, and those details probably made you feel even more leery. I will stay until the court determines both her adamancy and her wisdom in choosing me. I hope you examine those details, as I hope your opinion is always open to influence. I've prepared something for you. I don't think I can give it to the g.a.l., because then she gives it to donna's attorney and they fixate on every last detail and the trial goes nuts. But I can give it to you, and you can do whatever you want with it. I thought about the most influential way I could honestly and completely show you some of the details of our lives together. i realized that if i choose what to show you, then you aren't getting every detail--then i'm selectively choosing. but if i give you <em>every</em> image, video, and word where i am with either chloe or emily, then you can find whatever conclusion you want, knowing the scope. in other words, i know of no other personal document where we are together. you will find no other picture, video, or word of us that i'm aware of. If you formed an impression during noise and conflict, perhaps you can form additional impressions using this comprehensive source of digital data. You and I see why we can only call this stack 'Chloe and John's Past Together&quot;. So many places I've taken her, so many places she wants to go. A lot of the outcome will hinge on your balanced appraisal. I CAN PUBLISH THIS FOR CHLOE AND ALSO SHOW IT TO JONI, SO IT'S A TWOFER. IT'S A TWOFER, THERE IS ONE OF ME, I CHOOSE TWOFERS ONLY. fuck onefers, do the twofer.</p>
<p>Why do we all lay in bed so much? because we're both disabled. I've attached information about that. I also take hot baths as therapy. So of course we all took baths together. I have to lay down and have to take hot bat</p>
<p>Emily wanted me to raise Chloe since 2012 and earlier. In her will, she specified Donna and Richard, because I hadn't volunteered yet. I still wanted Chloe to be in a better home than Donna's, and I thought Darin's home was better, because I thought Mariela is a good mom. So I tried to persuade Emily to change to Darin and Mariela for Chloe. And I failed. She told me clearly that she chose Donna over Darin. Knowing what I know now, that's a great gut decision she made. I have never felt Donna's a great mom, due to her religion and mental health. Emily and I didn't always agree. For example, she didn't know her parents would work this hard to sabotage her. I kind of did know that Donna would not keep her promise to Emily that I would stay in Chloe's life. I saw Donna as more extremist than Emily did. Emily loved these people, but she still had very clear understandings of them. In the end you have to ask yourself not just if Emily was wrong all those years, but if she was right all those years. Incredibly right. Donna's theology is fear. She's teaching Chloe fear now. I'm chided on &quot;boasting&quot; now. Donna loves all that submissive junk. Emily definitely agreed with me on that: Donna lacks self-respect in some way. I see this from a more urban perspective, that Donna is submissive, in her personality, and that's ok, but she shouldn't push it on people, especially children. I'm convinced Donna hurt all the girls she has raised. EMily had debilitating anxiety and left for the Marines at age 17. Why did she have that problem when raised in that environment? Because living was prohibited. Boasting, aspiring, being audacious, everything's about to break, everything's dangerous, against a rule. So I had to come to Tacoma. I don't want Chloe to go through that. This photo was taken while I moved to Tacoma, and Emily and Chloe attended the Nutcracker. On that day, DOnna made a fuss because she preferred that Chloe attend church. Emily valued a free, all-transportation-provided viewing of the Nutcracker more than she valued &quot;religious&quot; church attendance. You must see a risk to any child of sexual violence as terribly serious, and you should. I see a risk to any child of religious violence as terribly serious. I see 4 examples of religious and psychological violence against 4 women. I see it put ripples into their lives that have caused them harm, not help. I know the terrible psychology that accompanied some of it, and attribute it to severe mental emotional illness, an explanation I learned from Emily, and I know it has done damage to Donna, and it will do damage to Chloe, as it did damage to all the women of the family. i was alone with chloe at occupy seattle. I know Alece used to send these to you, and you talked with her about a few of them. I have a meaner attorney now, so I will say my two cents if you prefer. In this report, what Chloe said to me was alarming. She said it in concrete terms, as quoted, and then during &quot;make-believe&quot; she explained it in elaborate detail. She described a family battle between Orcas and Dolphins, with her as mermaid to fix it. I am going to tell Chloe she can also fly, and fly away from that old battle, which she said with unusual passion: The conflict began when the King Orca told a lie! Chloe is of uncanny intelligence and I feel like a critical element to both her intellectual, creative, and psychological well-being. I'm not playing some parlor trick with her, and not manipulating her. I am solely listening to her over many years, and building stories with her. She is the source of the stories. And she knows--she knew earlier as a young person, but she knows well now--she can tell the tale of anything going on in her life with me and I will let her explore it. How this relationship got so sliced into panic for so many is another story. Endulge me a moment by considering a quote from Chloe, one of the many life-changing statements for me. I had written small, concrete poems about Chloe living with Mariela. (I advocated for that from Dec 2012 to November 2013, but that's a different story.) Emily, Chloe, and I would read these by candlelight. Chloe was deeply touched that her well-being was paramount in the writing. I had written fanciful stories about Sparkles the Pink Pony for her before, filling little notebooks with the tales of Sparkles, a fictional character I invented for her when she was 2. And she looked at me in October 2013 and said, &quot;You know how you write Sparkles stories? Write a story called: John and Chloe's Future Together.&quot; I hope you can reflect on this request as I did. I knew I had to be able to write that story. That moved me to secure a permanent place in her life. That's obviously all I've tried to do. So it was the question posed by your client that put a substantial change into motion. Now it is a question you can answer better than I can. I've given a great deal of my life to her already, but I can't proceed without your blessing. I am preparing a lot of stuff, including a project about Sparkles the Pink Pony, that I hope you will examine, but mostly I hope you continue reading accounts of my interactions with Ms. Murphy. What Donna's doing now is convincing Chloe to settle for a severely limited exposure to me, and believe me I regret Ms. Irvin's concurrence. I find Donna desperately depressing and paranoid, to Chloe's detriment, and I changed my life to prevent Donna from raising Chloe. To have to watch it in slow motion from a worsening position of power gives me a feeling for the bleakness of death, as Emily felt. She never wavered from her position, and rarely cried, so I will continue. I will seek the endorsement of Pierce County as a party to be trusted among children, including this child, as Emily clearly understood. Where do you, as Chloe's representative and advocate, stand on this wilful and systematic harm to her confidence and ambition? I see that Heather Y</p>
<p>Would you like to examine my collection of hard drives and other storage techniques?</p>
<p>Would you welcome a court order to rec over 5 years of text messages between Emily and me?</p>
<p>why do you think i came to tacoma? i see donna's psychological defeatism and i see what it did to the self-confidence of 4 children already. the chloe you met was emily's child. chloe is transforming into an insecure child, cautious to the point of indecision. chloe is becoming donna's child. i pledged to prevent this. i have not given up yet.</p>
<p>I'm already seeing what Emily dreaded: Chloe says proud statements are &quot;bragging&quot;. I say pride is generally healthy and positive. Donna's theology says women and girls should refrain from standing out, being exceptional, and feeling proud. Donna's psychology also says this. Chloe regularly calls me out for &quot;bragging&quot; now, and I consistently and vocally reject these new lessons she has learned. But she will need more than occasional reinforcement to escape this trap of sexist psychological harm!</p>
<p>I haven't been sure if you still read these. I thought I'd point out this particular paragraph:</p>
<p>At one point, Chloe asked Mr. Dempsey if she could have a room with a slanted wall that she could paint on, if she were to one day live with him. Mr. Dempsey explained to Chloe that �things were not yet figured out� but that he already had a house in Seattle. Chloe asked Mr. Dempsey if she could live there with him. Mr. Dempsey responded by telling Chloe �That�s not figured out yet, but hopefully you will be able to see the house someday�. Chloe continued to ask Mr. Dempsey about living arrangements and each time Mr. Dempsey explained to Chloe that �things were not figured out yet�. Chloe asked Mr. Dempsey if she would still be able to see her grandma if the courts allowed her to live with him. Mr. Dempsey repeated himself, and explained that he had promised her mother that her grandmother would always be in her life. Chloe then told Mr. Dempsey that �Grandma said that if she gets me, you can still see me two days a month. That�s better than no days right?� Mr. Dempsey continued to redirect Chloe, explaining to her that things were not figured out yet, but that she did not need to worry about it.</p>
<p>I am inclined to tell Chloe that I can ask you to call her, if she has specific concerns.</p>
<p>Obviously I am inclined to ask the court to order Donna to stop talking speculatively. Donna hasn't chosen to learn a thing about Chloe's emotional needs in this experience.</p>
<p>The observer said &quot;they returned to the living [sic] to play pretend.&quot; I wish the observer detailed the pretend, because it was remarkable. Chloe knows Darin lied and started the war between our families. She knows she was treated as a pawn, rather than the king. While she once spoke definitively, she's more powerless now, willing to settle for bleak offers from Grandma that should not be heard. I knew many years ago that Donna uses children to carry out family objectives. As resilient as Chloe is, she cannot indefinitely resist the unreality that Donna prefers and advocates. It's like a fog pervades the kids of Donna Mairs. Emily saw through it, transcended a childhood of severe anxiety, and joined the Marines at age 17 to &quot;escape&quot;.</p>
<p>I have other things to say, unwilling to stay silent, but I am waiting on many things, most importantly my new attorney, who is very busy on other cases. Quite a few of your requests will be in my motion, if that's how it works. Please expect news before month's end.Donna's values are reflected in her 3 daughters, who have struggled to stand out in the &quot;real world&quot;. They have real talents, but can't outrun the deviousness of Donna's psychology. Yes, I believe that.</p>
<p>I've appended my response to Question xx: Chloe makes elaborate make-believe scenarios that are usually obvious mappings of her experience onto a make-believe land.</p>
<p>Most recently, January 11th she described a sea of two species, the orca whales and the dolphins. She said they did not mix due to</p>
<p>a lie told by the king orca a long time ago. She played the role of a mermaid, going between the parties to resolve things.</p>
<p>Prior to this role-play, she explained Donna's &quot;offer:&quot; That I could be allowed to visit twice per month. She asked me if she would be able to visit Donna if she lived with me. I said of course, and explained it was a promise I made to Emily.</p>
<p>This relieved her. However, I said, &quot;It's not in Donna's hands. It's not in my hands. It's not even in your hands. So we don't have to worry about it.&quot;</p>
<p>Obviously she does worry, wishing for a resolution, acutely inferring the nature of the conflict. <em>I do not embellish any of these explanations. She does! I do not.</em></p>
<p>You must evaluate the value of my relationship with her. And maybe since these things are clearly on her mind, and she 's clearly trying to negotiate</p>
<p>the gap between Donna and me, maybe you, as her representative in this process, which solely exists to help her... maybe you should contact Chloe and discuss these matters,</p>
<p>as a person who does have a great deal of authority in your hands regarding her future.</p>
<p>She has insisted at various times to talk with you. I'm not sure why the observers omit these requests she makes. I have told her she has a right to speak to her attorney. Specifically that conversation went like this: Supervisor said I could only pass mail to my attorney. Chloe said, &quot;You have an attorney?&quot; I said, &quot;Yes. Her name is Alece.&quot; She said, &quot;I want to talk to your attorney.&quot; I said, &quot;Well, you have an attorney, too. Her name is Tracy.&quot; She said, &quot;I have an attorney? I want to talk to my attorney RIGHT NOW.&quot; I said, &quot;And it's your right to.&quot;</p>
<p>You did meet with her following that conversation. Now that it's clear we will go on for months in court, Chloe deserves an information source that is solely committed to her well-being, including her emotional and psychological well-being during and surrounding matters before the court.</p>
<p>Please consider my view that a uniquely intelligent child needs more than simple reassurance that things will be ok for her.</p>
<p>I am pleased to specify her as a witness in her court cause. But prior to the trial, she deserves assurance and even specific information to the level that Donna and I both receive from our able counsel.</p>
<p>Donna Mairs has told Chloe that the portion of Emily's brain that made her want to attend church was removed in an operation.</p>
<p>She has told Chloe that Chloe would reside with uncle and aunt upon Donna and Richard's passing. Ms. Mairs has implied that my family includes bad actors, from whom Chloe must be protected. Donna told Chloe that a future under Donna's authority includes little of me. Obviously Donna lacks all authority to make these kinds of statements, but continues doing so.</p>
<p>So I'm asking you to confer with your client with some additional regularity on matters currently facing the court regarding her future.</p>
<p>I don't know if my case is complex, having no experience in these matters, but I'm told it's a very complex case that will take many more months than usual to resolve.</p>
<p>In that period, please routinely inform Ms. Murphy of developments that impact her, or for which her views may be critical to your decision-making,</p>
<p>and please represent both her needs and her wishes above all other considerations and parties.</p>
<p>=== QUESTIONS FOR TRACY</p>
<div id="blah">
<p>I tried to persuade Emily to change Chloe's guardianship to Darin, rather than Donna. I was naive about how messed up Darin is. Emily said, &quot;I have to go with my gut. Donna is better than Darin. If you don't like it, come change it. Come to Tacoma and be the guardian.&quot; She persuaded me by choosing Donna, because I knew Donna would lock Chloe up. And I'm right: Donna fears not just me, but my uncle, a retired educator, and my father, a retired teacher and police officer. Donna is afraid of the world, black men, Seattle, R movies. I was absolutely right. Donna promised Emily that I would stay in Chloe's life, but then Donna called me a &quot;child&quot; and this made Emily very angry. I think she concluded that she doesn't trust Donna much. If not fake, they are incredibly dishonest, a sort of maliciously fake.</p>
<p>Would you like to contact my family, the people who spent the most time with Emily, Chloe, and me? Most in my family have advanced degrees, most in education, some specializing in at-risk children. My mother taught children Chloe's age for 30 years. She has spent more time with us than anyone else. My family has strong opinions what it's like to watch me be subjected to now 5 investigations, and yet never to be contacted--not one time--to be asked about Chloe's relationship with me. We are heartened to know we will have a trial where we will be heard. I'm not sure there's much use offering you court orders to unlock text messages, if you've never even called my mom.</p>
<p>When I go to putt putt golf, and nobody's around, it's gettin wild time. But certainly that's not my only way of being. That's the enthusiasm she and I have felt for 5 years together, when we first get together, it's hyper. It's simply what you saw when you saw us get together. Play the golf! Crash the car! It's a FUN PLEX. I can't really decide if your prose about my enthusiasm is criticism or not. I just wish you'd see us go bowling, cuz that gets really wild... we cheer regardless of shot. We roll around on the floor with silly enthusiasm. It's one of the things we do. Just one.</p>
<p>And you need to see me, and all of that, for the wholesome love it always has been, for me, Emily, and Chloe together.</p>
<p>I made a party happen in a little scooter box. I got them to the park for outdoor movies, with an inflatable mattress on the bus. I made memories for them. I am still, and for life, obligated to Emily to do so for Chloe. And I'm a loving person with a healthy sexuality. This will be clearer soon. And when it is, I ask you to remember: I'm great in Chloe's life, and Emily worked very hard to keep me there. Since we've met, my step-father has died. Each time he spoke, he said, &quot;I'm praying for you and Chloe.&quot; Please consider the finality of that relationship. And consider the rest, as they too fade from Chloe's mind.</p>
<p>This is the first stretch of her birthday, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's she will be away from both me and my family since she was 2. But I will remain her sole memory of them, until you release me from state's custody, expensive and humiliating, ultimately demeaning because such clear evidence of my love for her, and soon of my overall sexual health. my committment to my duty stands for itself, the more time passes. That's what I think any honest guardian for Chloe would see in striking relief. This is clearly someone who has given a lot of his life to her already. He seems committed to staying that course. Maybe we should give the guy a hug, or a medal, rather than all this shit. He is facing down some messed up people on behalf of two angels. Maybe that guy's fucking great for humanity and country and Chloe Murphy, who says as much about him.</p>
<p>you propose to torture me, make me watch from afar, as the exact catastrophe i fought to prevent comes to pass. i will make sure you know how chloe turns out, confidence crushed from her, just like her aunties. i will live with it forever. i want you to do so, too.</p>
<p>I got her to highly valued therapy. Exceptional therapy. She should resume there. I should be trusted to resume there.</p>
<p>I want to tell you that I see Chloe very actively trying to negotiate the conflict. I am refusing to do this with her, but she seems very eager to resolve matters. She gave a remarkable, vivid metaphorical explanation of things she sees them:</p>
<p>See Chloe position herself as peace-maker, confounded by the conflict, but trapped in it. She is not powerless in this plight. She is assertive, outgoing, committed, and astute. But anyone representing her needs to actively involve her in timely information, not just act on her behalf. I never provide information. Donna provides way too much. But Chloe has accurately inferred there are two options possible, and her life in either--why is she trying to rationalize taking an extremely weak hand? Donna has squished <em>her</em> down to bleak prospects. I want to respond to her, but first I ask you to approve this sort of statement: Don't settle for less than we have now. Settle for much more.&quot; Why is she feeling compelled to negotiate with Donna? Internalize Donna's fears about the big, bad world. I won't settle for that. But she's 7 and I'm 45. I have more practice battling evil, bleak offers. I will make it hard to hold on to such extreme positions.</p>
<p>I do not know what the issues are around this behavior. I know she is trying rather desperately to return to a normal set of relationships beyond this conflict. She also assumes duties considering Donna's offers, relaying them, and trying to negotiate with me. I reject this behavior, and strongly believe it's harmful. It clearly shows Chloe wants to resolve the ongoing conflict and secure the fruits of peaceful family life. She just seems to consistently define me in that family. As did her mom, as do I. So Donna's low-ball offers need to stop reaching Chloe's ears, please. I don't know the psychological implications but this conflict simply has Chloe as its victim, now ferrying offers and attempts at reconciliation. It's hard to explain to her that Donna doesn't cooperate. It's hard to explain to her the full scope of Donna's subversion of free life. Her mother's, now hers. The full scope of that lie will become apparent. It is already apparent to Chloe what the Orca King did. He told a lie!</p>
<p>In a world of the jungle, where no court can help, I would shake Chloe a bit and ask her, &quot;You'd really settle for two nights a month?&quot; Of course not. Nor would I. But I am much more cautious with my words than Donna Mairs. Should her campaign to persuade Chloe to choke me out of daily or weekly life be accepted and ignored? Why is Chloe being asked to rate proposed settlements? Why doesn't Donna propose them to me, and leave the child out of that kind of discussion? I would appreciate that level of respect, as it's disrespectful to ask Chloe about any of that. Of course I know psychological abuse is all about persuasion. You persuade her real good as usual.</p>
<p>Most recently, January 11th she described a sea of two species, the orca whales and the dolphins. She said they did not mix due to a lie told by the king orca a long time ago. She played the role of a mermaid, going between the parties to resolve things.</p>
<p>Prior to this role-play, she explained Donna's &quot;offer:&quot; That I could be allowed to visit twice per month. She asked me if she would be able to visit Donna if she lived with me. I said of course, and explained it was a promise I made to Emily.</p>
<p>This relieved her. However, I said, &quot;It's not in Donna's hands. It's not in my hands. It's not even in your hands. So we don't have to worry about it.&quot;</p>
<p>Obviously she does worry, wishing for a resolution, acutely inferring the nature of the conflict. <em>I do not embellish any of these explanations. She does! I do not.</em></p>
<p>You must evaluate the value of my relationship with her. And maybe since these things are clearly on her mind, and she 's clearly trying to negotiate the gap between Donna and me, maybe you, as her representative in this process, which solely exists to help her... maybe you should contact Chloe and discuss these matters,</p>
<p>as a person who does have a great deal of authority in your hands regarding her future.</p>
<p>She has insisted at various times to talk with you. I'm not sure why the observers omit these requests she makes. I have told her she has a right to speak to her attorney. Specifically that conversation went like this: Supervisor said I could only pass mail to my attorney. Chloe said, &quot;You have an attorney?&quot; I said, &quot;Yes. Her name is Alece.&quot; She said, &quot;I want to talk to your attorney.&quot; I said, &quot;Well, you have an attorney, too. Her name is Tracy.&quot; She said, &quot;I have an attorney? I want to talk to my attorney RIGHT NOW.&quot; I said, &quot;And it's your right to.&quot;</p>
<p>You did meet with her following that conversation. Now that it's clear we will go on for months in court, Chloe deserves an information source that is solely committed to her well-being, including her emotional and psychological well-being during and surrounding matters before the court.</p>
<p>Please consider my view that a uniquely intelligent child needs more than simple reassurance that things will be ok for her.</p>
<p>I am pleased to specify her as a witness in her court cause. But prior to the trial, she deserves assurance and even specific information to the level that Donna and I both receive from our able counsel.</p>
<p>I have a long list of statements Donna has made and continues to make that mislead Chloe about her future. Due to her age, 7, and despite a sound mind, she is unable to discern propaganda from reality in these interactions. Donna Mairs has told Chloe that the portion of Emily's brain that made her want to attend church was removed in an operation.</p>
<p>She has told Chloe that Chloe would reside with uncle and aunt upon Donna and Richard's passing. Ms. Mairs has implied that my family includes bad actors, from whom Chloe must be protected. Donna told Chloe that a future under Donna's authority includes little of me. Obviously Donna lacks all authority to make these kinds of statements, but continues doing so.</p>
<p>So I'm asking you to confer with your client with some additional regularity on matters currently facing the court regarding her future.</p>
<p>I don't know if my case is complex, having no experience in these matters, but I'm told it's a very complex case that will take many more months than usual to resolve.</p>
<p>In that period, please routinely inform Ms. Murphy of developments that impact her, or for which her views may be critical to your decision-making,</p>
<p>and please represent both her needs and her wishes above all other considerations and parties. === TO TRACY BEFORE PSYCHO-SEX EXAM COMPLETED</p>
<p>I believe Donna and Darin both say what they think &quot;will work&quot; at the moment. I suspect this will cause a lot of strange statements when they are faced with the long and complicated story, and explaining their roles in it. Whereas my story is absolutely consistent. Their depositions will be crazy, especially Darin's, because lying persuasively is all he knows. I look forward to it. My family is offended. You haven't helped because you haven't asked anyone what they know. Everything I've explained they would explain. That's how the truth works. But try that with Emily's family and the witnesses against me. Bettina... I have text messages of her saying I'm doing a great job as a parent. And now she's a witness against me? It will be a funny trial.</p>
<p>Allison said in a text message on my phone that the household was &quot;no guidance just shove...&quot;</p>
<p>Meanwhile I've never hurt Chloe. Doesn't that strike you as unbalanced, that I'm so fascinating and they're so messed up that WHAT YA GONNA DO ya throw your hands up and say, &quot;Sorry, Emily.&quot; And shoo me off?</p>
<p>It might help for me to explain in plain language how to understand the period between December, 2012 and November 2013: I was Emily's first pick for Chloe from 2012 and probably before. I thought Donna was a bad choice for Chloe, so I advocated for Darin's home. But Emily thought Darin was a worse choice for Chloe than Donna. We debated for many months. I failed to persuade her. So she said: &quot;If you don't like it, change it. Come to Tacoma and be the guardian.&quot; So I did.</p>
<p>I couldn't live with thinking Donna would be raising Chloe. As for why that is... I think she's a spooky basket case. I certainly think I would give Chloe a much better life, because I am healthier in most every way. Rather than unhealthy or threatening or harmful, I believe I'm healthy and nurturing.</p>
<p>That's been a part deliberately confused in this case: Emily saw and understood all of this. She loved them and me enormously. She still saw serious, dangerous, and destructive flaws of her birth family, in particular her mother and her father. I am not exaggerating or mis-attributing my own conclusions here. Darin made sadistic, seductive, emotional appeals, badgered, schemed, twisted, purjered. He is exactly what she described: Very screwed up. Emily knew these things about Darin, and explained them to me, not the other way around. But she and I were pretty shocked at how far Darin and Donna went to subvert her wish. By the time it was hitting us, with severe psychological violence against us and Chloe, it was too late to move further away. (We originally planned to move to Seattle, but she just didn't think it was realistic.)</p>
<p>I came to Tacoma to raise Chloe at Emily's request. Emily had very sound judgement. Absolutely I'm not perfect! But I am a uniquely trustworthy, generous, wise man. And Emily had serious reasons for her decision, which I know the court will conclude at trial. The court will conclude Emily chose me of her free will, using very sound rationale and very acute awareness, not just of me, but of her parents. And Darin proved to be exactly what she described: Very screwed up.</p>
<p>You both can conclude that Emily was just wrong. That's a question you should ask and answer.</p>
</div>
<p>Additional Sources In 2014, planning between Emily and me became verbal. In November, 2013, I began talking on the phone daily with a wide group of friends and family for advice and guidance. I could provide a list of their names and phone numbers. They could substantiate many details in this document. While I have tried to provide an accurate account, including accurate dates and incident details, I could improve accuracy and add details by comprehensively analyzing these sources:</p>
<p>Go to 201 South Jackson for Emily's orca card info. try emily's notebook computer on the orca web site. could reveal!</p>
<p>I remembered this detail about Andrea: Emily told me all of Andrea's children have serious emotional problems, not just Darin. She said one child is a drug addict.</p>
<p>Now see Darin's perspective: He thinks I'm vulnerable. He thinks, ah, with the right persuasion, I can be smeared. I'm wierd. I lay down and take hot baths. I sing and act goofy. i'm a joke. Or worse!</p>
<p>And I didn't kiss his ass regarding Emily's choices. Emily controlled them. That drives him mad. So he has this case, built over many weeks and months, where he created a lot of noise.</p>
<p>I will also make noise.</p>
<p>Of course I invite Katy to RCR to meet me. Of course. Openly.</p>
<p>lj: Show Chloe her past there. In words. There's an easy angle. PErhaps just export it to some HTML self-contained publication. Or just copy and paste into Word. I have a limited ability to dredge through it. Emotionally. And why? Because it may persuade and win cases. It deserves to be rolled into one publication. What might I do? I'll decide then.</p>
<p>A publishing access model that uses Facebook to give aCcess if us just opt in via Facebook. And a whole story with secret and Public and group view limits. And inline images critical.</p>
<p>Why did you omit the letter from Patricia Dempsey to Joni Irvin? I've attached the similar declaration here. The letters in favor represent people of advanced training in child education who have known me at least twenty five years. The letters opposing me are people who have spent less than an hour speaking with me.</p>
<p>I have quite a few other resources. Some would take a court order, while others would just take leg work. Emails, text messages... all would tell the same story. If you think I've lied about a single word, please allow me to substantiate with a flood of facts.</p>
<p>I tried to persuade her to choose Darin. I failed. Then I accepted that I must act or see her lost to Donna. Donna told Emily I would stay in Chloe's life but I think that was a lie. Donna called me a child and Emily began doubting donnas promise. That statement made Emily very angry.</p>
<p>emily and i disagreed for many months before november, 2014. she said donna was better than darin. i said darin was better than donna. eventually she went with her gut, and totally rejected darin. that forced me to take action, or see chloe raised by donna.</p>
<p>during this process donna also showed herself to be untrustworthy. she had assured emily that i would remain in chloe's life. later she called me &quot;a child&quot;. this made emily very angry.</p>
<p>I could prepare a timeline of key statements that would make sense of it. Both Darin and Donna showed their word to be untrustworthy very early on. Emily noted this very acutely. There are many people who spoke with her about it. I could provide a list.</p>
<p>My step-father died suddenly on Thanksgiving morning. He was one of 5 career educators who spent the most time with Emily, Chloe, and me. Try to understand my family's perspective: Yours is the 5th investigation, and they are the people who spent the most time iwth us 3, yet no investigator has ever asked them anything. They also want to know if innuendo is enough to subvert Emily's clear wishes. They all knew Emily and Chloe very well.</p>
<p>Barbara A Helmer-Hartman said June 3 at 1:44pm, prior to ever meeting me: &quot;Just let me know when and where and I'll be there if you need any help with Keeping Chloe with your family. We ALL can witness that you would be a wonderful person to raise little Chloe.&quot; She is welcome to witness. She is not welcome to lie. But she lied, to APS, CPS, and to the court. Oh, Barbara!</p>
<p>She tells me routinely that she wants to see my father and my half-sister, Jeanine. What does it mean to represent a seven-year-old? Do you wish to protect her relationships, or rip them out like weeds?</p>
<p>Darin pledged full support for the adoption in November. He aTtended one bridges therapy Where he appeared to support us. Early December he switched. 2nd adoption meeting he claimed the December meeting never occurred. His daughter Melissa was there, as was his 3rd wife.</p>
<p>If he is sure I'm a molester, why did he pledge full support in November? Follow his logic of the 2nd adoption meeting:</p>
<div id="raw">
<p>There was even an interesting time where I tried to accept Emily's choice of Donna over Darin. I couldn't do it. I had to do something to prevent Chloe from being raised by Donna. Obviously their skillfulness with fear-mongering and hysteria, and probably my laid-back nature didn't help. The city tried to chew me up. If a preponderance of evidence says I'm just too damn different, and Donna's actually Donna Reed, then fuck me with a 2x4. That's the whole dumb case in the whole dumb court. I'll stand for that verdict. Because it will also be made clear that Darin Murphy abused his daughter as she died.</p>
<p>I want to clarify I point that might seem confusing at first: From April to November, 2013, I tried to persuade Emily to specify Darin and Mariela as Chloe's guardians. I failed to persuade her. She knew her dad had serious emotional problems, and I just didn't see it from a distance. She said she had to go with her gut. She said Donna would do anything for Chloe. And she said, near November 12th, 2013, &quot;If you don't like it, change it. Come to Tacoma, and be the guardian.&quot; When I accepted that offer a week later, it was Emily who had persuaded me. I had failed to persuade her. I said I would try ONE TIME and I did try. I failed, and changed to a position of supporting whatever she wants, as long as she wants it, until the day she changes her mind. I hope you consider this position to be the precise formula of unconditional love. I am deeply offended by the various spins used to make it sinister, but I'm used to feeling deeply offended by this family of jackels.</p>
<p>I also want you to understand how this all looks to my family. My family has been very closely involved over the entire year. I called at least a few of them every day. Yours is the 5th investigation of me. Through the 4 previous investigations, no member of my family has ever been contacted. But the G.A.L. is supposed to be different. You are supposed to get to the bottom of things. For every minute I ever spent with Andrea Mattson, I spent hours with my mother or father, with Emily and Chloe with me. My whole family is educators. I hope you ask yourself if it makes sense I could conceal a harmful relationship in front of them over 5 years, when I couldn't apparently hide my allegedly wreched nature from Andrea for 5 minutes. My step-mother was Washington State's teacher of the year. My mother was Sumner School District's teacher of the year. Paula Brown is an educator, first aid instructor, and Washington State track and field official of the year. My father is a retired police officer and teacher's union president. Not much gets past these sorts of people. Andrea Mattson is a senile woman who abused her children.</p>
<p>In her letter, Andrea Mattson asserts that a savage sex assault occurred either December 1st, or January 2nd. In her two calls to CPS, she asserts the assault took place January 1st. Ms. Mattson says she has a detailed scheduling method. Chloe and I arrived in Mexico on Christmas, and left Mexico on January 1st, during a ferocious rainstorm. All three dates are impossible. Is she my accusor?</p>
<p>There are &quot;early months&quot; to this story which you have not asked about, but perhaps you will. My dialogue with Emily began in her hospital room in March, 2013. Quite a few turning points transpired, including lies that persuaded Emily that Donna was not trustworthy and Darin was scheming. I can recount the specific statements and events that made this clear to Emily. Let me know if you'd like to know exactly what was said to and by me and Emily in our interactions with Donna and Darin during these &quot;early months&quot; prior to November, 2013.</p>
<p>Chloe launched my change of heart when she asked me to &quot;Write another story called 'Chloe and John : our future togEther'&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe has attended Christmas Eve at my sister's home in Olympia since Emily and I met. Chloe has spent the night there every year. My family misses Chloe. Could you allow Chloe to spend a bit of Christmas, Christmas Eve, or some other day with my entire family? I have attached extensive photographic evidence of these relationships.</p>
<p>Candace Zygar claims Chloe is &quot;nervous, etc&quot; in my care, and that I am &quot;a social reject&quot;. Now over 100 pages of visit reports contradict her first claim. On Facebook, where my life updates get 20+ &quot;Likes&quot;, Candace has two Facebook friends. One is Darin Murphy. Why isn't Candace owning up to her declaration by appearing as a witness? Is Candace my accusor?</p>
<p>I remember taking Chloe on the carosel in Westlake park.</p>
<p>&quot;Christine, I had a question about the report on11/23 with Charlotte at the home of Howard Dempsey. Charlotte states that Howard went down stairs to watch sports on TV and Chloe followed shortly after. Mr Dempsey finished cooking the rice and we too returned downstairs. Did she leave Chloe alone with Howard downstairs?. I just want to make sure that Chloe is not to be left alone with anyone while at a visit. Let me know.&quot; Donna is afraid of everyone. Everyone is dangerous, including my uncle, a respected retired junior high school teacher. I have many other instances of Donna feeling afraid: Of downtown Seattle during a bus transfer, of black young men.</p>
<p>Chloe called me dad consistently from age 3 - 6. Only when placed in Donna's custody did she return to John, which she also used when she was 2.</p>
<p>&quot;Grandma says Mom doesn't go to church because they took out the part of her brain that makes her want to go to church.&quot; - Feb or Mar 2014. This is the kind of &quot;believe what I prefer to believe&quot; thinking Donna specializes in. It is untrue and unfair.</p>
<p>Darin gave full support for adoption during November 2013 meeting.</p>
</div>
<p>West corridor house is gauntlet of rusty equipment and tools. I was very afraid for Emily's safety when she'd walk that dark passage. You should have looked.</p>
<p>It occurs to me that you probably have few other sources for understanding what happened before November, 2013. Emily wanted me to come to Tacoma. Twice she said, &quot;Come to Tacoma and be the guardian.&quot; Four or five times she just asked me to move to Tacoma. In November I agreed to do so, and be Chloe's guardian. There was a brief time in November when she essentially interviewed me, and Emily was a brutal negotiator. I came, and she was very happy about it. Once her parents determined I was relocating, they attacked her, and I realized I had to give her a new home to keep her safe.</p>
<p>One source we have with a court order is the extensive cellular phone text messages. That's where both major decisions and minor details were discussed. I believe the case against me is a collection of innuendo and claims out of context, rooted in financial and religious motives. The best defense against it is a massive release of information. I've been reluctant to authorize it, because it could as easily be used out of context. But if you seriously doubt Emily's thinking, then that information would help.</p>
<p>Instead, you seem to believe she was mistaken about me, over all those years. Her words couldn't change that view. But if we reach a point where you think she had good judgement, choosing me over her mother for Chloe, then we can consider getting the order to show you these additional details.</p>
<p>Questions to pass to the examiner: Aside from toilet training, have you touched Chloe's vagina? Have you and Chloe stood naked in the shower with your genitals exposed to her? Did a sexual attraction to pre-teens cause you problems as an adult? LEAVE THE BONER OUT OF IT.</p>
<p>The most serious allegations in this report are based on false statements. I don't know if that's intentional. There is some context here.</p>
<div id="f-sarah">
<p>Sarah's three previous reports were mediocre. Previously, she missed important details about Chloe's behavior and indications of Chloe's feelings, yet she included many details that just didn't matter. While the other three supervisors described Chloe's demeaner upon first seeing me (&quot;greeted with hugs and smiles&quot;), Sarah omitted key statements and clues from Chloe indicating or suggesting emotional state.</p>
<p>For example, I only said &quot;I love you&quot; without prompting once in this visit. Chloe initiated &quot;I love you&quot; the remaining times, to which I responded in kind. Sarah documented these interactions incorrectly as flowing solely from me. She did not document that Chloe initiated most of the hugs, but misattributed them to me. I'm convinced she doesn't &quot;see&quot; Chloe in a critical sense. She's too focused on me for some reason I don't understand.</p>
<p>I knew the three other supervisors I'd worked with did a better job, so eventually I began expressing a preference that Sarah not be assigned. Her supervisor eventually asked me why I felt this way. I believe my criticisms may have been shared with Sarah, because she arrived at this visit with a note pad for the first time, and for the first time she wrote a thorough report. However, in addition to false details, this report fails in the same way as the others: Chloe's indications of feelings are still not as apparent to Sarah as they are to the other three supervisors.</p>
<p>Chloe does try to climb on me, and I prevent her from doing so. There are many documented instances of this delicate dance to avoid &quot;prohibited&quot; contacts in past reports and in this one. I do ask us to step back and acknowledge that we are talking about a child who lost her mother 5 months ago. Since age 2, Chloe and I engaged in active play, including dance. Emily, Chloe and I enjoyed visiting Festival of Dance Improvisation (SFADI) in Capitol Hill, Seattle each Sunday, where we and other families developed movement awareness and trust in a bright studio with a mirror wall.<br />
(I have been a member of this dance group for eleven years.) It is clearly absolutely foreign and frightening to Chloe that upon her mother's death, her interaction with me is heavily regulated and limited. She's accustumed to gymnastic activities with me. I've done my best to comply with CFS guidelines about contact, but my primary goal has been to meet Chloe's emotional need for reassurance in this difficult period. It's telling that this report contains a high number of reported violations of contact policy, all of which begin with Chloe approaching me. She clearly enjoys dancing and derives comfort and joy from the experience. This visit was not unusual in this respect. The only change is that Sarah chose to pile on every perceived violation of the policy. (Which only explicitly applies to lap-sitting.)</p>
<p>The claim denoted by Footnote 5 is false, I did not, and do not, add any information beyond what Chloe says about her future plans. The quotation is incorrect. Chloe said she wanted to live in the same house, and I affirmed I would like that, too. I did not add &quot;the same house&quot;; it was in her original statement. I also strongly support her claims of independence, and her wishes for her adulthood. I have never suggested--not in all my life--what she might do when she's an adult, except attend college and establish a career. But when she asserts that freedom can be hers at a certain age, I hear a child longing for her choices to be in her control, and philosophically I have a tough time failing to validate that thinking.</p>
<p>The claim denoted by Footnote 7 is absolutely false. I never made this statement. I never said &quot;I'll get you back.&quot; We were discussing how much I love Chloe, and I said, &quot;You bet I love you. I keep coming back [to see you]!&quot; I would not harm Chloe with a statement like the one attributed to me. I encourage Sarah to sit much closer to us. Most of her livingroom observations were made from across the livingroom and diningroom, a distance exceeding 30 feet.</p>
<p>The sand doesn't turn to mud. It remains sandy. It was my understanding that the goal was not to require a change of clothes, and a change of clothes was not required. I don't question the authority of CFS to conclude visits based on violations of plans or policy, but is there a line of common sense somewhere?</p>
<p>The most serious accusation in this report is based on events which I remember quite differently. When I asked &quot;How many 'i Love yous' and 'how many daddy's?'&quot; she had heard, the supervisor clearly responded with an affirmative. I said my status as Chloe's dad is disputed, and Sarah smiled and clearly said &quot;Oh yes it's clear!&quot; She did NOT say I must stop! So I proceeded to explain why I felt Chloe's feelings deserve a more central role in the reporting: Because I am the subject of a smear, because it's been alleged that I have no legitimate relationship with Chloe or Emily. While I am a passionate speaker, I was in no way out of control, My ultimate motive was to communicate about, and try to understand, why statements about Chloe's emotional context are consistently lacking in Sarah's reports. At some point Sarah did say she would not discuss details of the case with me, so I moved to safer ground: Where are you from? What's your favorite song? How's the weather? I've asked two other supervisors where they're from, and got two answers in the past. I believe most people would receive this subject shift as a clear intent to respect boundaries, but Sarah did not. I want to add finally that her statements opposing discussing where she's from or her favorite song were accompanied by a smirk. What kind of verbal assault victim smirks? I finally laughed to myself because despite my best efforts, I felt alone in the room. Howard Dempsey, owner of the house and retired career schoolteacher, overheard the conclusion of the alleged verbal assault and considered my efforts at calm communication to be appropriate, while her responses were unusual. He describes Sarah as bizarre, cold, and clearly in the wrong job for her skills and traits.</p>
</div>
<p>Paula Everdell, Howard Dempsey, and Jeris Ockfen are distinguished career educators who have attended a visit while Sarah supervised. They all have misgivings about the nature of communication mandated under CFS rules, where many of the fundamentals of parent-child interaction are precluded by an almost obsessive list of prohibited behaviors. Touch, only as an example, is a critical part of effective parent � child communication. Sarah's interpretation of the rules appears to prohibit an entire arena of effective interpersonal skills. I understand and accept this as the nature of the situation, and I engage in a delicate dance to comply with these rules while providing Chloe with the reassurance she clearly seeks from me through dance and play.</p>
<p>I intend to be more explicit with Chloe about the full scope of the rules she's subject to. I don't imagine it will be hard to meet the guidelines as stated in this visit report. I do ask you to find some perspective: A child wants to dance with me and dream with me about a future much like her past, where we associate freely in activities we both enjoy. And the child in question needs hope and affection to a degree very few children ever feel.</p>
<p>If Sarah would like, I am happy to speak with her away from Chloe, in the presence of a family member, and would provide a clear and sincere apology for the distress I may have caused her.</p>
<p>I've learned the CPS investigation has closed. I understood this to be the reason why supervision was required. I hope that question could be revisited soon. Emily taught me her parenting formula: (1) Love (2) Patience (3) Love. I am patient but am also sure I will cry my eyes out the next time Chloe and I walk to the park by ourselves again.</p>
<p>She's going to see Joni Irvins notes... that's where the smear began and seeing its embryonic form in Jonis notes taken the day after the super bowl would fascinate me. Darin wanted the Helpless Brain Injury Daughter In Distress angle to work. I think he also began claiming there that I am a pedophile, due to the way Joni responded to something I said about my volunteer work with children.</p>
<p>Calls to cps are exempt from slander claims, as are declarations exempt from libel claims. So a meeting with Joni... probably exempt too.</p>
<p>Anyway... id like to meet with Tracy first.</p>
<p>Oh here's Emily: http://soot2.livejournal.com/1459.html ... as if she ever doubted.</p>
<p>Visit was solid gold. Except when Chloe sees Emily on the tablet she always zooms in on her eyes and wants to make her big big big. &quot;But We should be together.&quot; Lots more lists of what we will do as soon as she is old enough to choose where she lives. I told her to keep a list for her attorney tracy.</p>
<p>New theory: Darin quit when he lost control of the money.</p>

<p>I think we face a few goals that need to work together:</p>

<li>I get in fighting shape for the g.a l. Interviews.</li>
<li>We ridicule the g.a.l. funding delay only after our cps plan is underway because ithink cps makes our b breaks me.</li>
<li>I interview first with the g.a.l. if possible.</li>
<li>We drop &quot;a brick&quot; on camille. Bookworm? We shall see about that.</li>
<li>I wonder if a personal letter from me could come after the brick.</li>
<li>We twist Camille... if she has already rendered the opinion about Chloes exposure to me, and the brick gets nothing , then we say hey, you say this should stop, its not stopping, use your evidence to make contact stop, aren't you negligent if you do nothing? or here are the 18 people John stayed in close contact with across last year, often for hours a day. There are no omissions and you can call them all. Some have advanced credentials. Some are mandatory reporters. What more could possibly be delaying you?</li>

<p>Chloe has a strong, healthy parental bond with me. study the visit reports. we engage in creative play that far exceeds most children in complexity. She and I are unusually intelligent and unusually creative.</p>
<p>Chloe's grandmother has a pattern of poor parental decisionmaking, history as an abuse victim, and abusive behaviors In the 80's, with 4 children, the household hosted lsd, alcohol, and sex parties. Donna and Darin engaged in &quot;swinging&quot; including sex outside their marriage. Darin was notorious for being an absentee father to his children, according to the father of Bettina W Allison was barred from visiting their home based on observations of these activities by Allison's parents. Chloe experienced at least two sex assaults at the hands of her older female cousin in donnas home, said Emily. Her Cousin was Previously sexually assaulted by an adult sex offender who had befriended her family. Once the cousin promised a real unicorn in exchange for sexual contact in the attic. The other assault entailed tasting each other's genitals in the bath.<br />
Chloe described the second assault to me.</p>

Jennifer dated a Level 1 sex offender who attempted to drug and rape her friend. look at the outcomes for donna's children - paralysis, an inability to make decisions and be confident</p>
<p>Chloe's grandmother's husband engages in dialogue with Donna that Emily described as &quot;borderline abuse&quot;. In my appraisal, he is a &quot;man-child&quot; who is typically playing a video game while watching t.v. in his recliner.</p>
<p>Chloe's grandmother is abusive. During a conflict about which car Chloe should ride in for 10 minutes to the same destination, Grandmother engaged in screaming and abusive speech in front of Chloe, who cowered behind me. endless use of guilt and abusive use of conflict. each time she would return from grandmother's, I would be hit with guilt and shame tactics, but I would insist neither Chloe nor I had done anything wrong, so I don't feel guilty or ashamed. Chloe would eventually cry, and after that the guilt and same tactics would not re-appear until her next visit to Donna's. &quot;secret&quot; conversations with a 6 year old. Every statement Chloe attributed to grandmother during our first court-ordered visit characterized abusive use of conflict: &quot;Grandma says I can't see you and can't see anyone in your family, not even Epona.&quot; &quot;G7randma says you weren't mom's partner.&quot; &quot;Why won't you give back mom's phone? There's someone on it who has a horse I can ride instead of thinking about mom's death.&quot; This is grandma telling a 6 year old child whose mother just died that she can't ride a pony because John won't return Emily's telephone. &quot;I can't go to Gilda's Club. Not even Camp Sparkle.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe's mother had a dream the dream is that chloe have a life outside the family, because the family has serious patterns of emotional abuse rooted in darin and donna, reinforced and justified by their mormon theology, but also deeply reinforced by Darin's abusive upbringing at the hands of Andrea Mattsen, who abused him severely until he was removed from her care. Emily described her father as &quot;really screwed up&quot; and described her mother as &quot;a punching bag&quot; we have evidence of Emily's competency that we have not introduced in court she worked with 4 attorneys trying to accomplish the dream</p>
<p>I am completely open to investigation and study. All members of my family are happy to meet with you. Many are distinguished primary and secondary school educators. Most have observed me with Emily and Chloe routinely over 6 years of time. All data on my computer archives is available to disclose. However, as a data professional, the task is complicated and will require unusually advanced planning as we ll as exploration of my legal risk to NDA violation. I can prepare a private viewing of all video and images of Chloe and Emily in my possession.</p>
<p>These mental health professionals have exposure to Chloe and awareness of her relationship with me: (updated list is in sent email)</p>
<p>Emily felt both Donna and I are essential parts of Chloe's happiness. My position will keep Donna, but Donna seeks to remove me, contrary to Emily's evaluation.</p>
<p>Is it correct to conclude that Donna specificly objects to Chloe sitting on my lap?</p>
<p>I'm offended by your description of &quot;the nature of this case&quot; because I and my family believe this case</p>
<div id="speculate">
<p>We call it The Choreography of Paranoia.</p>
<p>I've attached a photograph of Chloe with me in the water, and one of her in my lap. So many to choose from! Imagine how confusing this is for Chloe, and how clearly these changes empower Donna's documented campaign of parental alienation. Not that there's much we can do about it, as for now Chloe is in Donna's custody. But at very least I hope we can call this all what it is.</p>
<p>I can convince Chloe it's Fall and splashing around outside isn't going to work anymore. She craves swimming with me indoors, too. But that's not the point. I'm the guy who taught her how to swim, whose lap she's sat in since her 2nd birthday. Are there alternatives to crushing the comforting ties she has left from those early days? I bet you must also be dealing with Donna's pattern of badgering, blaming, and screwing up.</p>
<p>Hypothesis: Donna is playing cheap by trying to use the few tons of hand-me-downs that Epona outgrew. Hypothesis: Donna is gaming the system by trying to �set John up.�</p>
<p>Observation: �Maternal Grandmother stated she had requested that Christine remove me from the case� and I wonder if this was done through the court which ordered the visitation with supervision or is this, once again, ex parte? Did Charlotte know she was persona non grata. There is still a measurable effect of such interference in that any party to an on-going process is impacted by any part of the interaction. And, while I appreciate the heads up on Donna and her paranoia and willingness to game the system, I wonder how one party properly objects to the process and participants in the supervised visitation. Apparently Christine Hanson chose not to be moved by Donna�s pleas and protestations but there are larger issues here.</p>
<p>Observation: �Chloe asked to sit on Mr. Dempsey�s lap� is an indication of Chloe�s need to sit on her Dad�s lap.<br />
This is the same problem in both the geography of communication and in the non-verbal dimension as well as it impacts the volume at which the strictly verbal interaction happens. All communication is at least three levels simultaneously. First there is the geography within which it happens and then there are the plethora of non-verbal cues surrounding the interaction and finally somebody opens their mouth. One of the absolutely best indications of � distance� is when a kid sits on the lap of a cherished adult. I am concerned that the underlying efforts to extinguish the kid�s need for the intimacy satisfied by sitting on laps is being extinguished by the paranoia of adults who are packing a huge load of their own issues stemming from their own childhood betrayals. Very bad situation when the physical is excluded from the process. The physical dimension was one of the key clues to interaction for fully armed rookies studying communication so nobody got shot was what they see. I taught communication for a half century and on many levels and always wonder what definition precludes elements from a process.</p>
<p>Observation: Christine Hanson, by prohibiting �water activities,� is allowing Donna, the maternal grandmother, to game the system by either being incompetent or by deliberate manipulation of the clothing. BTW clothing choices, whether made by a kid or by an adult, are part of the non-verbal communication process. Like laps, water and playing are part of any healthy communication process. Remember that communication has elements of place (geography) and both non-verbalized and verbal elements. If I didn�t believe the beach to be an important part of the experience I would have lived raising kids in a much different way. I was raised at Crescent Beach on the Straits and spent happy hours both wet and sandy while I got sunburned to a crisp. My own kids lived at Lake Sutherland and fond memories carried them to adulthood.</p>
<p>Observation: All Donna has to do now to terminate a visit where Charlotte is to be the supervisor is to pack two bags . One, if inspected will contain inappropriate clothing and the visit will be �immediately terminated.� She avoid ever having to confront anyone over the identity of the supervisor thereby avoiding reporting that is not of her liking. While on that subject we can assume she doesn�t like Charlotte and her evolution as a supervising observer as Charlotte moved from the observer of mundane, and usually trite and trivialized stuff, to a more purposeful documenting of interactions as they occurred between real people. I can assume that Sarah will eventually figure it out and Donna will grow to hate her.</p>
<p>Horrible question: I am fascinated to know what happened to Chloe�s bike as that edges into child abuse. Kid has bike. Dad loves to bike and has frequently done biking with the Chloe and then kid does something maternal grandmother doesn�t like and kid has to sell bike. How do I report that and where is the accounting of the money?</p>
<p>What accusation or claim most accurately characterizes what you consider &quot;the nature of this case&quot;? There are two closed CPS complaints, compliments of Donna's family, both (utterly) unfounded! Have you reviewed those 60 pages and would you like to?</p>
<p>I used to take Emily and Chloe to contact dance, where we all interacted through climbing, dancing, swinging, and spinning around with each other. It was among our favorite things to do. The new rules might be utterly clear to extremists, but they clearly frustrate Chloe, who demands the simple comfort she understood since before she was 2. Can you tell us exactly what the rules are?</p>
<p>The word &quot;inappropriate&quot; flows like water around here, but all &quot;appropriate&quot; behavior seems to do is produce more messed up kids, like ones who lose their mom to cancer and then their dad to bureaucrats.</p>
<p>What accusation or claim most accurately characterizes what you consider &quot;the nature of this case&quot;? There are two closed CPS complaints, compliments of Donna's family, both (utterly) unfounded! Have you reviewed those 60 pages and would you like to?</p>
<p>I describe the nature of this case thusly: Donna and her family make hysterical accusations, raising uproar after uproar, accustomed to wearing people down until they give up. When you give up, Chloe loses. Here's why:</p>
<p>This child, whose diapers I changed, who sat on my lap since before she knew the word &quot;yes&quot;, who I taught to swim, who swam all last summer with me while her mom cheered from the shore, loses more and more of these connections to the past, loses more of the reassuring comfort I've always provided, loses the continuity her mother and i fought for , and i still fight for.</p>
</div>
<p>I used to take Emily and Chloe to contact dance, where we all interacted through climbing, dancing, swinging, and spinning around with each other. It was among our favorite things to do. The new rules might be utterly clear in extremist circles, but they clearly frustrate Chloe, who demands the simple comfort she understood since before she was 2. I require a clear explanation, and Chloe deserves one. Tell me exactly what the rules are. The word &quot; inappropriate&quot; flows like water around here, but all &quot;appropriate&quot; behavior seems to do is produce more messed up kids , like ones who lose their mom to cancer and then their dad to bearucrats.</p>
<p>and then get badgered away from their dad.</p>
<p>I'm thinking of wearing red underwear outside my clothes, and letting Chloe do the same, Then I will relay the precise rules to her.</p>
<p>I don't think Sarah understands any of this.</p>
<div id="intimacy">
<p>The latest wave is &quot;lap-sitting hysteria&quot; and I am curious where it came from. Kids sit on the laps of cherished adults. The goal is probably to extinguish Chloe's need for the intimacy satisfied by sitting on laps, driven by the paranoia of adults who are packing a huge load of their own issues stemming from their own childhood betrayals. Donna is an extremist. Delivering rigidity.</p>
</div>
<p>If the Mairs screw up, do not imply I am anyone but the guy ready to care for the child.</p>
<p>I'm in Superior Court at incredible cost so the Mairs won't quickly crush the close relationship the child has with me . But maybe they will do it slowly, through repeated bungling. But</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Sarah's reports are lengthy yet omit critical details. All reports are reviewed by my team, which includes people who taught report-writing for police and emergency response organizations. We worry that Sarah's unfocused reports could distract the GAL from the clear patterns shown in reports from all other supervisors. All reports are entered into the public record for this case. Obviously if Donna orders a report then one will be prepared . We have other critcisms of Sarah's service, but We just struggle to justify the expense of paying for Sarah's reports.</p>
<p>Repeated failures by Donna Mairs to accomodate swimming apparently makes wading impossible. Why does it seem like the change punishes Chloe and me most of all?</p>
<p>Also, I have reviewed the closed cases, and learned what you meant when you asked if I &quot;jump on and bite&quot; Chloe. She was referring to a disciplinary act we called &quot;time-in&quot; which contained her and asserted authority. Containment could be confused with &quot;jumping&quot; on her, and growling could be confused with biting. This technique is a healthy and positive way to reign in a child who is asserting dominance over adults. Emily and I practiced it since Chloe was very young. Ask Chloe about &quot;time in&quot;.</p>
<p>The other thing you said the one time we met was that &quot;that shouldn't occur with people who are not biologically related to the child.&quot; Kyle Coker, the man you claimed cared for Chloe has abandoned her yet again, but I won't. I have only sought to make the ongoing parent-child relationship legitimized by law. I can only describe your statement as rooted in 19th century thinking. Is this really the view of CPS, that only biological relations are culturally acceptable to meet all the various needs of a child? I wish we had a recording of that unusual statement during that interview.</p>
<p>Finally, I know I requested the closed documents before Heather Young did, and I know you provided them to her a month before you provided them to my attorney. You affixed a smiley face to her copy, and she thanked you for your extremely responsive attention. This is bias.</p>
<p>So of course I think about you, and wonder how your investigation is going. You have contact information for a lot of people I spoke with and saw throughout this period. To my knowledge, I know of no friend or family member of mine contacted by CPS. Not a single one. But perhaps I'm mistaken. Time will tell.</p>
<p>Hi, Christine.</p>
<p>I describe the nature of this case thusly: Donna and her family make hysterical accusations, raising uproar after uproar, accustomed to wearing people down until they give up. When you give up, Chloe loses. Here's why:</p>
<p>This child, whose diapers I changed, who sat on my lap since before she knew the word &quot;yes&quot;, who I taught to swim, who swam all last summer with me while her mom cheered from the shore, loses more and more of these connections to the past, loses more of the reassuring comfort I've always provided, loses the continuity her mother and i fought for , and i still fight for.</p>
<div id="ranty">
<p>Today I shopped for child suspenders.</p>
<p>Do not let their underperformance harm her relationship with me.</p>
<p>Every parent I've asked says they've done everything I'm &quot;accused&quot; of doing. Lap-sits, shoulder rides, 6 year olds watching cartoons in their room (with no clothes! shock!). This child has never showed a single indication of experiencing sexual abuse, nor has she ever articulated anything like it. Nor do I have any history of abusing children, nor does anyone in my family. Donna's family, however, has a complex history of abuse.</p>
<p>So we hear lots of rumblings, but never any smoking gun, about my alleged sexual abuse. Ok, what do we clearly see? We see extremists getting their way through badgering, judicial abuse, underperformance, and lots and lots of &quot;there' s a crisis!&quot; handwaving. When you take something from Chloe because Donna can't handle simple details, Chloe loses. Why not ask me to provide suspenders first?</p>
</div>
<p>Your organization may be asked soon to evaluate my parental skill. Surely that could include documentation of all the ways I compensate for Donna's pattern of failures (like providing child suspenders). At least give me that option before taking away treasured opportunities like splashing at the beach. I've always tried hard to work with you to make clear plans and solve problems. Could you return the favor when problems arise?</p>
<p>What accusation or claim most accurately characterizes what you consider &quot;the nature of this case&quot;? Would you like to call 2 child psychotherapists I call personal friends? A social worker? An R.N.? 5 career educators who know me well? They all agree: The nature of this case is judicial abuse driven by religious extremism and anger. At the last hearing , 12 people sat with me for 3 hours while Donna sat alone. So there might be a very different &quot;nature&quot; to this case than you realize. I provided not just a beach, but a beach house with a career educator to assist where I cannot. I disappear when Chloe needs a simple shower. Tell me, what about the nature of this case is problematic here? Go ahead , be honest.</p>
<p>I can convince Chloe it's fall and splashing around isn't going to work anymore. But who knows, we might drag on into next summer. She craves swimming indoors, too. Maybe it's smart to hash out some strategies for dealing with Donna's clear pattern of dropping the ball. I'm always available to work with you.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Em Chloe and I regularly sang in a Seattle group. All of this is gone from chloes life and she is incredibly suited to this kind of expression.</p>
<p>I can't wait for your investigation. I know you got a report from Katy Johnson about an allegation of a video of Chloe dressing. I brought this video to the court, and showed it to the G.A.L. who found no sexual content in it. How come you haven't asked to see the video?</p>
<p>I figured out what you were referring to regarding &quot;jumping on&quot; and &quot;biting&quot; Chloe. It is not &quot;jumping on&quot; but rather holding her, and it's not &quot;biting&quot; but just growling, for the purpose of asserting dominance when a power struggle is in process. Emily and I call this &quot;time in&quot; and it works.</p>
<p>I have completed the information release forms I received via US Mail on Monday, except for one document. I currently reside with my brother and his daughter Epona, who is 13. I will need to prepare another authorization form for her.</p>
<div id="history">
<p>I moved to my brother's home when Emily died and Chloe was taken because he is uniquely qualified to help me at this time. Last year he married in a fun wedding Chloe and I attended. Four months later his wife died suddenly. At the same time, the mother of his daughter produced an enormous, disingenuous, and unsuccessful case for custody opposing him. When you review his and his daughter's DSHS files, you will see a wall of accusations and claims which the court and G.A.L. ultimately rejected.</p>
<p>I consider the resemblance between my year and my brother's 2013 to be uncanny, as I hope you will soon understand. In fact his child's mother recently mentioned me in a new declaration seeking custody by claiming neglect of Epona. Though she is barred from meeting secretly with Epona, she included pictures from secret meetings. She also asserted that I might be responsible for Emily's injury. (I gave Emily brain cancer?)</p>
</div>
<p>Based on her past behaviors and this reference to me in a new declaration, we speculate that she's the so-called &quot;friend&quot; reporting to C.P.S. Time will tell.</p>
<p>I am not an attorney but am an investigator and look forward to this process. I consider anyone representing Chloe to be my natural ally, but understand the necessity of due diligence in response to all allegations and claims. For example, I know you seek the Mary Bridge intake from early 2013. Sylvia's report appears in the DSHS open file. When Emily and I met with Sylvia, she said she had discovered literally no clues suggesting the sexual assault took place. Presumably anything in the medical examination would be a clue. Emily told me there was no &quot;physical exam&quot; because the interview with the nurse did not indicate any cause for one.</p>
<p>Donna and her family have a pattern of abuse spanning at least 4 generations, which I will describe. I am not spiteful or petty, and have deep empathy for Donna Mairs, but there are substantial reasons Emily chose me to raise Chloe, based on intimate knowledge of her mother. But for now I must prepare these 20 pages!</p>
<p>Jason Dempsey:</p>
<p>On October 26th, 2013, during a family trip to Olympia, Emily relayed to Jason that she was excited to know John would care for Chloe after she was gone.</p>
<p>On one Saturday I cared for Emily while John took Chloe to Gilda's Club cancer therapy. John provided a clear and understandable table for scheduling and logging medication administrations. The prescription instructions for all medications were clearly displayed on the cabinet doors around the medication preperation area. I set alarms on my smartphone based on the clear medication schedule John provided.</p>
<p>Chloe chose John as much as John chose Chloe.</p>

<p>==== STATEMENTS OF CHLOE MURPHY</p>
<div id="spitball">
<p>You now have strong evidence that I've never sexually abused Chloe or any child. Out of necessity, with a wisp of new details in their quiver, the intervenors pivot to a brand new thesis: That I'm violent or threatening. I know my life story. I know I've never hit anyone, never fired a gun, and never threatened anyone with harm. Since I've never done such a thing, there could never be evidence to the contrary. Only innuendo and misappraisal could suggest otherwise. Innuendo and misappraisal can be frightening, but no court can let it suffice. The intervenors have failed to prevail through four hearings; the court has been my strongest ally in the struggle to make evidence and wisdom prevail over innuendo and fear.</p>
<p>Videos have played an unusually central role in the claims of the intervenors. First there was a video I created with Emily and Chloe that I don't believe Donna Mairs has never seen, which she knew for certain showed a serious crime. Now there's a video the intervenors apparently can't stop studying, which I did not create, but only captioned with five words. In the modern era it's strikingly easy to choose the wrong words and click the wrong button, sending the wrong message, a message never intended as it was received.</p>
<p>I must insist that the matter before the court does not hinge on two videos or five poorly chosen words. These are side-shows and distractions from the massive body of evidence submitted in this matter, which includes the declaration of Emily Murphy, over 150 pages of observational reporting prepared by professionals, a declaration from the state's leading expert on people who hurt children with abusive sexuality, and a polygraph from a leading specialist in the field.</p>
<p>Willful misinterpretation is at the heart of both the Intervenor's case and their family psychology. I've seen over decades how Donna Mairs and Darin Murphy fixate on a single detail amidst a sea of details that contradict it. It's how they lie without technically lying. It's psychological abuse based on wrong-headed perfectionism designed to induce crippling shame to control behavior. It is exactly the pattern I have been trained to completely reject when interacting with children. I watched their 4 daughters experience withering criticism built on this unbalanced use of a single detail. I watched them cry as children, feeling ashamed and helpless merely because Donna or Darin built a severely critical interaction based on a single detail of imperfection or error. I watched them abuse their daughters . And I watched what this behavior did to their daughters' self-esteem. Emily insisted this pattern stop with Chloe.</p>
</div>
<p>How do you wish and choose to appraise me? What does the preponderance of evidence show to be my nature and character ? And what is merely a detail, tiny and contradictory against the norm?</p>
<p>The iconography of conflict.</p>
<p>Do we agree? Often not. And the words do fly like bullets in a court room: Innuendo, slander, voice inflection to cause alarm.</p>
<p>People come and toss &quot;daggers&quot; in a court. The process is very adversarial. To a newcomer like me, that can feel like quite a fight. But it's not literally a fight, and that's the point: The court exists to prevent violence while resolving conflict. I stand in defense of this principle, not against it! It is freedom's greatest promise in a just land.</p>
