<h1 id="life">Life</h1>
<p>Emily told me many times, and asked if I agreed, that life is a great gift. It is. No bill is due--it is a gift--but what other word can describe it? Joy often requires adversity and sorrow.</p>
<p>She did not want to die. She would get mad at cancer, want to punch it, for taking her away from you. I agree again. I was with her at the moments she got the worst news. She absolutely hated dying, because she could not watch you grow.</p>

<p>Emily approved of you making up your own mind. We talked about it a lot. Don't fall for all the &quot;weak tea&quot; in the world. She approved of you singing, dancing, expressing yourself, and being quiet or private. She told me <strong>respecting yourself</strong> is the most important thing you need to do. She said each time she had not followed her gut instinct, she regretted it later. It was her gut instinct that brought me to Tacoma. She told me to tell you: Respect your gut instinct. Respect your body and your feelings. That means listening when they give you clues, and respecting your wisdom. To stand a chance at happiness, you must choose your own life. You'll be unhappy with the life others would happily choose for you.</p>

<p>Once Fatima came to the apartment where we all lived, by Wright Park. She really liked the place. She wondered, &quot;How can I get a place like this?&quot; Emily said, &quot;First, join the Marines. Serve eight years. Then get brain cancer, and get medically retired. Easy!&quot;</p>
