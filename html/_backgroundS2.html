<p>Some in my family were offended when I was omitted from Emily’s obituary. But who took the picture of Emily in the obituary? I did.</p>

<p>Mario and Soledad are Mariela’s parents. They never were officially married, until April 18<sup>th</sup>, 2009. I believe this is the day Darin spanked Chloe, age 22 months. I took these pictures of their wedding, using Darin’s camera. The ceremony was May 2<sup>nd</sup> while the official wedding was April 18<sup>th</sup>. I took these photos, aren’t they nice?</p>

<div id="10jun-mex">
<p>Invitation: As you might gather from his web site, Darin was trying to start an “organic, in-town, real Mexico” tourist service. Mariela had a friend who worked at the airport, in a Mexican apartment. Their idea was that the woman and her son would stay elsewhere while we rented their home. This didn’t really work: The apartment was very hot and very small. So after calling 6 other leads, they found an exceptional condo for us, with a pool. T.V., breezy, nice place. And this Frida Kalo knock-off, starring Emily. This is where I taught Chloe to swim. Darin stayed near Mariela’s family, with Candace and Candace’s (step?-)sister. We called that place The Hacienda.</p>

<p>Chloe’s 3<sup>rd</sup> birthday. I’m pretty sure I paid for at least half of that bouncy castle, and at least half of that piñata!</p>

<p>Darin made Hugo, his fireman friend, a really strong lemondrop, and Hugo got sick. Later that week, Hugo drove Emily, Chloe, and me to Las Palmas and we rappelled off an old bridge there. Below was a river with water like a bath, and we had a swimming picnic.</p>

<h2 id="mexico-travel-3-december-2012">Mexico Travel 3: December 2012</h2>
<p>Emily was going to travel with Chloe, but had medical priorities, so she invited me to go instead. I thought about staying in Tacoma with Emily, but I was actually dating Mel. So I paid Darin $500 for the $740 ticket.</p>
<p>Darin’s family let Fatima and Julieta join Chloe and me at the pool. There seemed to be no concern.</p>
<p>I REMEMBER the look Darin gave me when his mother Andrea must have told him her allegation. It was much earlier in the trip than Andrea says in her letters (which specify 3 different dates, all too late, and all impossible). I was pretending to be a momma bird with Chloe, while Emily was on Skype. Darin looked at me more intensely then ever before, and my silly thought was that for once he might jump in here and care for Chloe in an emotionally connected way. But no, it was probably Andrea.</p>
<h3 id="hysteria-strippers">Hysteria strippers</h3>
<p>The strip club’s name was Hysteria. It is a known tourist destination in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. The dancers performed one at a time on a catwalk while staff pushed overpriced drinks to intoxicated Americans. Then performers offer to dance in laps in exchange for bracelets purchased on the customer’s tab. I would describe it as dimly lit. Darin Murphy (Emily's father) made arrangements for some of us to go to Hysteria. Darin took us to the club without warning. I had never been there. Darin told me that all dancers in the club sold sex, even those who say they do not. I don’t know if Darin had been there before. He did say he had been to the “local” strip bars in Puerto Vallarta, which he characterized as friendlier than the tourist-oriented Hysteria.</p>
<p>While at Hysteria with Darin Murphy and the other members in our group, I sat in a chair at the end of some small drink tables. A stage was to my left, along the left side of the little tables in front of me. Along the right side of these tables sat Mark Deutsch, then Melissa Vulliet, then Rob Vulliet, then Mariela Murphy (Darin's wife). Darin Murphy sat in a chair you might say was at the other end of the tables, face-to-face to me but at some distance (the distance of four adults sitting side-by-side).</p>
<p>I saw Mariela and Darin engage in sexual contact with at least two strippers/prostitutes (&quot;entertainers&quot;) while drinking distilled alcohol. Darin kissed and touched at least one stripper all over, who kissed and touched him all over. Darin's third daughter Melissa and her husband Rob also employed entertainers for sexual contact while drinking distilled alcohol. I only drank a single rum and Coke, and did not purchase sexual stimulation. However, in talking with an entertainer, <em>I</em> offered <em>her</em> a lap dance, which she accepted. It was tasteful and included little touching, and she laughed, I think sincerely. Darin brought us all in the same vehicle to the club without warning. I would not have joined if informed of the destination. During the evening I only practiced Spanish with the entertainers I met, and provided modest compensation for their time.</p>
<p>I estimate all participants to be in excess of 20 years of age. The two I spoke with were single moms. Chloe stayed with Mariela Murphy’s family while we were away. Darin Murphy said later that a stripper he hired there asked for 25 (pesos or dollars) to get cocaine. He told us that he declined. Mariela Murphy said to me later that extramarital sexual relations were ok with her so long as she remains the primary partner.</p>
<h3 id="a-real-massage">A Real Massage</h3>
<p>A few days after the strippers, Darin drove us to buy real massages in the tourist part of town, and we all did.</p>

<h2 id="other-holidays-with-darin">Other Holidays with Darin</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>I’ve spent Christmas and New Years with Darin in Mexico twice.</p></li>
<li><p>Christmas Eve at his fire station. At xmas eve fire station played gun combat simulation game and watched fatal attack on afghanistan combatants by droNes. He also explained his database work was unauthorized on the TFD network, and he was told to disconnect it.</p></li>
<li><p>Thanksgiving in Spanaway with Mariela and her kids. (For a year or so, Darin lived up the road from my mom.) It was the year of the big snow. Mariela asked for a recipe.</p></li>
<li><p>On another Thanksgiving I showed friends the firehouse where Darin was liutenant. He introduced us to his crew. An alarm rang and we all left quickly.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I skiied with Darin just prior to the first Gulf War, up at Snoqualmie.</p>
<p>Darin asked me for a place to visit in Seattle, and I suggested the Ballard Locks. I showed Darin, Mariela, Juan, and Fatima the locks. <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/107460598315429300090/Seattle2010" class="uri">https://picasaweb.google.com/107460598315429300090/Seattle2010</a></p>
<h2 id="mariela">Mariela</h2>
<p>The day Darin and Mariela came over, two days before the 2nd adoption meeting, Mariela strangely got vertigo. I think there was more than altitude involved. I think she was realizing Darin was involved in a &quot;reality vortex&quot; unique to his broken psychology of control. He made no indication of concern at that breakfast. They made stupid smalltalk and he studied everything in the house as he prepared his explosive speech.</p>
<p>Here Mariela takes a video of me with Chloe, along with her two children, as it starts to snow in Seattle:</p>

<h3 id="abuse-of-mariela-darins-3rd-wife">Abuse of Mariela (Darin’s 3<sup>rd</sup> wife)</h3>
<p>Based on comments made to me by Emily Murphy, Mariela Murphy (wife of Darin Murphy) was physically abused by her prior partner. Emily was aware of this based on the adoption interview and records for Mariela's son, Juan.</p>
<h2 id="control-devices">Control Devices</h2>
<ul>
<li>Darin sought Emily’s cellular phone one week before her death. He said this was “in case her friends call”. This did not make sense to me, as Emily had stopped answering her own phone regularly over a month prior. Her friends would call me, and I had referred them all to Mariela’s phone. So what friends was he referring to? How would she answer? As well, I knew her phone was an authentication key to her financial, social, and personal accounts, such as email, Facebook, and Tapco. She had entrusted me with her finances and email as her Financial Power of Attorney, and as the Executor of her Estate. It was not financially prudent to release this authentication key to any other party for any reason. I explained this position twice. His response was: “John! John! Her cell phone is her cell phone!” He then hung up as I responded politely that the device would not leave my custody. He continued demanding it in person, using notes. Had she sought to entrust her finances and personal communications to him, I imagine she would have placed him in these legal roles, or provided him with passwords. Based on his hostility and my understanding of Emily’s friendships, I doubt his stated motive—that friends might call. Call forwarding could solve that problem, for example.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sky-is-falling">Sky is falling</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Darin claimed vocally and repeatedly both Emily and Chloe were experiencing abuse. He worked two blocks away from our apartment on Tacoma Avenue, yet he rarely visited.</p></li>
<li><p>Darin says severely critical things in meetings that he does not say in private, one-on-one, conversations. Many times he had a cheerful conversation with me one-on-one, and shortly afterward he would severely criticize and accuse me in a meeting of authorities. He never discussed his serious allegations with me. In fact he carried on with me privately as if we were friends.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="section-1">2011</h2>
<h2 id="section-2">2012</h2>
<p>Some time around 2012, Darin came to Seattle with Mariela, Mariela’s sister visiting from Mexico, Juan, Fatima, Chloe, and me. And I think Emily was there, but I am not sure. We went to the Sculpture Park. It’s totally cool. There are pictures from that day. Then we ate at the Spaghetti Factory together.</p>

<h2 id="section-3">2013</h2>
<p>I took Chloe and Emily to a water park in or near Tacoma on five or six occasions in the summer of 2013. Emily was usually there, too, and sometimes Ally, and maybe Kris once. I mentioned this place to Darin a few times, inviting him and family. I went to Tacoma and saw Emily in Donna’s house. Emily walked Chloe to school throughout 2013 and was proud of the daily exercise. Throughout 2013, I was trying to undo the crazy shit caused by Andrea’s accusation. It wasn’t that Emily believed it, but it made everything harder for a while, as really we needed to talk about very uncomfortable things.</p>

<p>Halloween. Darin Murphy gave this a Thumbs Up on Facebook.</p>
<h3 id="april-emily-responds">April, Emily responds</h3>
<p>A sequence of events led to my acceptance of Emily’s invitation and request. I had begun thinking of Chloe’s plan in mid-2012. I went to Mexico to speak to Mariela about raising Chloe. Around April, 2013, Emily’s her home, I asked if Darin might be better than Donna for Chloe. Emily said, “Its not fair. I have a beautiful daughter and I can’t watch her grow up.” I agreed it wasn’t fair. Emily said she wanted me to raise Chloe. I wasn’t sure about my readiness, and I vastly overestimated the emotional health of Darin. So I advocated for Darin’s until Emily refused that idea completely, after the Uncle Howard meeting and the Long Weekend.</p>
<h3 id="early-november-the-meeting-at-my-uncle-howards">Early November, the Meeting at my Uncle Howard’s</h3>
<p>I organized a meeting at my Uncle Howard’s house. Darin, Mariela, Emily, and me. Emily was persuaded, but only briefly, that I was right when I argued for Darin and Mariela raising Chloe.</p>
<p>Emily said she did not want Chloe raised Mormon.</p>
<p>I said I wanted Chloe to have more opportunity, with technology and such.</p>
<p>“I felt manipulated.” –This was Darin’s response to the meeting at Howard Dempsey’s, suggesting I should feel guilty. Guilt is the family national anthem. In that meeting, Emily and I floated the idea that Darin and Mariela raise Chloe. At that meeting, at the end, Darin asked,</p>
<p>“What’s in it for you, John?” This seemed like a strange question to me. In a previous interaction he had already agreed that there are mental health problems at Donna’s home. I wanted to help Chloe reach a safer, healthier environment. What did he think my motive <em>might</em> be? Of course in his declarations he argues that my intention was to secure access to Chloe so I could sexually victimize her.</p>
<p>The evening after that meeting, in his home on the 2<sup>nd</sup> floor, Darin expressed concerns that benefits earned by Emily’s Marine service intended for Chloe would instead finance Mairs home debt.</p>
<h3 id="after-the-meeting-em-and-i-have-a-weekend">After the meeting Em and I have a weekend</h3>
<p>Following this meeting was a “long weekend” Emily and I spent together. She returned to Tacoma, to her father’s, and told him she had changed her mind again, that Donna was the better choice. Darin promptly wrote email to Mike Howard, while Emily called me and said, “Are you sitting down? I’ve changed my mind again.” Candace Zygar apparently said there’s no room at Darin’s, but Emily said this decision was hers alone, based on her gut. “I’ve ignored my gut before but I’ve always regretted it.” I said I felt sad. She said, “If you don’t like it, change it. Come to Tacoma and be the guardian!” I refused and she cried. It was the last time I refused.</p>
<p>I called Darin. I thought he’d also be unhappy about Emily’s shift, and he was… he was hard to read. At first he seemed to contradict what Emily said. Then he said I had it right. Then he yelled, “I’m supporting my daughter. I want her to have some comfort. What are YOU doing?” In another phone conversation around the same time he yelled that I should “Step up!” I found both statements motivational… and he also said in email somewhere that he supports what Emily wants. I thought, “He’s got the right idea. I’ll do that, too.”</p>
<p>On the day after Memorial? Day, 2013, I called Darin to express dismay that Emily declined to prefer his home to Donna's for Chloe's future.</p>
<p>Darin initially asserted that Emily hadn't said that, but eventually agreed she had.</p>
<p>He asked if I was in Seattle. He regularly brought up my residency in Seattle.</p>
<p>He said he was supporting his daughter, and asked what I was doing.</p>
<p>He then shouted that I need to &quot;step up&quot;.</p>
<p>I searched my soul. I considered marrying Emily and adopting Chloe. I called all of my friends and asked their views. Two in particular, Walter Wittel and Jan Dempsey, asked very hard questions about how effectively I could raise Chloe if Emily’s illness and care bankrupted our marital estate. But all my friends supported my decision to raise Chloe.</p>
<h3 id="november">November</h3>
<p>It was Thanksgiving, or perhaps the day before, or after. Emily, Melissa, Mariela, Darin and I visited the San Francisco Zoo. It was right across from the apartment where we stayed in two different rooms. Emily came to San Francisco for gamma knife treatment, but the doctor showed her new tumors, and explained gamma knife could not be effective. That night—a rather terrible night—Emily and I told Darin I would adopt Chloe, while Mariela and Melissa listened. Darin says this conversation never occurred.</p>
<h3 id="december">December</h3>
<p>Darin called Emily incompetent before leaving for Mexico, and this shredded Emily’s trust in Darin. Then both Darin and Donna began severely abusing Emily psychologically in response to her stated wish and plan for Chloe. I reported the abuse to my sister and uncle. Emily was very enthusiastic about moving in with me and being in a place where she is supported.</p>
<p>Emily appreciated the opportunity to vent without her parents present at Bridges therapy. In December, Bridges gave us a referral to Gilda’s club and advised Emily to find an attorney who represents her.</p>
<h2 id="section-4">2014</h2>
<ul>
<li>“You’re paying a pretty penny!” - Suggesting I should defer to his authority on real estate rental rates. In fact, the rent was not high, was stable (all utilities except electricity included), the view was lovely, and the location was about as convenient and fun as Tacoma gets. Emily paid less per month than she paid to Donna. Square footage is not the only way to think about real estate. Emily said about this comment, “Where was he when we were looking for a place?” He was in Mexico. After we had signed a lease, he appeared to want us to move, for reasons I do not think related to his stated reasoning. Emily was proud of our apartment and we chose it well.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="darin-sneaks-in-every-time">Darin sneaks in every time</h2>
<p>We lived on the 15th floor of a secure apartment building. &quot;Tailgating&quot; into the building was discouraged. I even had to rescue Jenny from outside when the building manager told her she couldn't sneak in. For a few months, the only way in was to call me or Emily on our personal cellular phones.</p>
<p>The call box at the door could only call local telephone numbers, and ours weren’t local.</p>
<p>This did annoy people, but I wanted, too, to personally accompany people up the elevator, at least at first. I wanted to know who was coming in, and perhaps why. This taught me a lot, as people from far-afield just appeared, some good, some bad people. I wanted to walk them in. Is that really so crazy? Anyhoo…</p>
<p>Eventually I got a local telephone number, and call box calls rang it. I could finally buzz someone in. I had this other phone with me always, or carefully controlled. I could buzz someone in from across town.</p>
<h2 id="competency-not-incompetency-was-the-problem">Competency, not Incompetency, was the problem</h2>
<p>Allegations that she was incompetent are not based on any information gathered from any professional who ever met her in 2014. She just couldn’t speak well. In fact, the hospice nurse, the highest ranking medical visitor to her bedside, explained the complexity of ignoring her POLST: So long as she communicated clearly--using blinks or hand-holds or anything—she was competent to make decisions about her end-of-life choices (or her will, or the custody of her child). In my experience, she was competent until the last day I saw her, a week before her death. Therefore, her father never had legal authority to modify her POLST, and the POLST he presented at her bedside was not signed by any doctor anyway. I had many conversations with her about her wish to have all means of life support and extension. Emily rarely changed her mind.</p>
<h2 id="darin-yells">Darin yells</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>At the 2<sup>nd</sup> adoption meeting, Darin yelled quite a bit. He objected to my sister’s “tone”. He was incredibly domineering.</p></li>
<li><p>At that same meeting at Madigan, Donna appeared to thank me for taking care of Emily, but exclaimed it’s just too dangerous living up there in that modern apartment. Darin told me, “Don’t bullshit me about what happened in that apartment last night, John!” What happened was: Emily was dying, peeing, vomiting, before the resources were there to give her hospice care. Bettina came in just at that time and cleaned her up with my father’s help. We decided she was dehydrated so we called 9-1-1. She was taken to the hospital. She entered hospice a few days later.</p></li>
<li><p>Darin also yelled on the phone about me delivering Emily’s phone to Darin, cuz I couldn’t. His yelling isn’t authentic, though it sounds so. It’s tactical. Whatever will work to get his way. What I’d give for honesty even if that entailed yelling. ;)</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="yelling-at-darin">Yelling at Darin</h2>
<p>The two times in my life I raised my voice to Darin Murphy both occurred in 2014:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>When I learned he was seeking to intervene in the civil case, he called to say he was coming by to serve papers. I told him, &quot;Do you think I'm going to care for Emily full-time while you resist us in court? The free ride is over!&quot; He asserted that actually it was my free ride that was over. I left the residence to my mom and dad so Darin had to serve the papers onto Emily's unconscious body.</p></li>
<li><p>As I left Emily's body in Darin's home, Darin said he wanted to talk to me. I said emphatically that I didn't want to talk to him, and walked away.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="stuff-darin-said">Stuff Darin Said</h2>
<ul>
<li>Once during a visit to Darin’s home, probably Emily’s last visit on her own two feet, I read a book to Chloe while Darin worked on some computer task. Mariela asked him if he was sure he wanted to work rather than just talk to us. He worked instead, sort of talking while he worked, and drove away to deliver a package at the FedEx or UPS office. Emily commented later that Darin didn’t notice me reading to Chloe, and this seemed to make Emily angry or disgusted. I think she tried hard to make her parents understand and accept her choice regarding me and Chloe. She would note with disappointment every time I was obviously doing healthy things with Chloe which they (especially Darin) didn’t seem to see.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><p>On two occasions to me Darin described Andrea (Emily’s grandmother) as being “manic”. Once she was making urgent requests for food or cooking purchases that Darin would not satisfy, because she was being “manic” in his view.</p></li>
<li><p>“This elevator is inadequate for Emily’s needs.” - Suggesting I should defer to his authority on adequacy of elevators. He said we should move.</p></li>
<li><p>Darin and his wife would arrive without calling ahead, and sneak into the building, bypassing the call box. He often seemed to have an ulterior motive for visiting. He eventually began making accusations. For example, he read the prescription for rectal lorazepam and claimed based on it that I was misusing oral lorazepam. Caregiver Mariah relayed to me that Darin asked her strange questions about medications, appearing to seek confirmation that Emily had been mis-medicated or over-medicated. Mariah explained that I was the sole medication provider, but he did not ask me. Hospice noted that they had high confidence in my administration of all medication. Hospice eventually agreed to call Darin regularly to appease him.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="feb-18-noon">Feb 18, noon</h3>
<p>Darin gets Emily into his car, drives her to Puyallup, tells her she’s being abused. She texts me from inside the car. Says she’s being asked a lot of questions by Darin. Says Darin expresses “concerns”. Emily concludes wishing for TWO way communication. When she returns home, she goes into the kitchen and starts crying, saying, “I like how we talk about our feelings here.”</p>
<h3 id="feb-26-noon">Feb 26, noon</h3>
<p>Darin calls at 10:30am, leaves me a voicemail asking if Emily wants to have lunch. I call Emily, who suggests Darin come over and she make him eggs. He came with Mariela. Mariela got vertigo, supposedly from the altitude. No concerns of any kind were mentioned. No questions were asked. It seemed cheerful. And then… a few days later…</p>
<h3 id="mar-6-2pm-2nd-adoption-meeting-joyce-robsons">Mar 6, 2pm 2<sup>nd</sup> adoption meeting, Joyce Robson’s</h3>
<p>Mr. Murphy blows his top. Attorney Joyce Robson, Joni Irvin, Darin Murphy, Donna Mairs, Jan Dempsey, John and Emily. Joyce thought Darin was the most domineering person she had ever met, and that he was demeaning to his dying daughter, Emily. Jan felt Darin channeled dark forces. I was just stunned, accused of a litany of crimes: isolating Emily? I’m not sure if brainwashing was said there, but he told Emily she was being brainwashed in December, and that was a huge error on his part.</p>
<h3 id="the-thing-between-you-and-me">The thing between you and me</h3>
<p>Darin began showing up with an entourage of family, usually on the weekends. First time this happened, in the hall, he said, “I’m coming over for Emily. This thing between you and me, that’s one thing. I’m here for Emily.” What is this thing between him and me?</p>
<p>The visits were cold, not respectful of Emily’s need for quiet, characterized by terrible food and a 2-Liter Coke, which would make Emily puke. Of course she requested particular foods and he tried to bring some. The care-giver Mariah said his visits were creepy and unhelpful. Mariah really did not like Darin. Let’s get her as a witness. She remembers all kinds of creepy stuff he did.</p>
<h3 id="bossy-mcbosserson">Bossy McBosserson</h3>
<p>For hospice intake at the apartment Darin showed up in heavy fireman apparel. It’s my understanding he works as a 911 dispatcher. He insisted the apartment was inadequate for hospice care, though the hospice staff assured him it was well-suited. He demeaned me in front of the nurse and social worker for failing to inform him of Emily’s seizure of March 17<sup>th</sup>. Emily still had the ability to call him had she wanted to. He asserted that his legal role as medical power of attorney obligated me to inform him about Emily’s medical care. The social worker explained later that hospice works closely with the care giver unless Emily becomes unable to communicate. Darin said the transfer we were doing from the bed to an in-room commode (or wheelchair) using a secure vertical bedside bar and a gait belt was unsafe. I studied professional training materials to learn this skill, and was assured by hospice staff and certified nursing assistants that my technique was correct and equipment was appropriate.</p>
<h3 id="apr-29-5pm">Apr 29, 5pm</h3>
<p>In the presence of two of his wives, Darin presents “concerns” to Herb and Pat at my apartment, as Jenny listens. Unfortunately, Herb and Pat only heard Darin fabricating anger and chaos so the attention could return to him. He didn’t have any actual articulated concerns. Pat asked if this was about money. He had no reply.</p>

<p>In May my father strongly suggested to Darin Murphy that a parenting plan should be established, saying templates are available. A parenting plan would include clear language about the inappropriateness of these remarks and behaviors. To date, no discussion of a voluntary parenting plan has occurred.</p>

<p>Report of an incident with Darin Murphy on 02 June 2014 By Herb Dempsey</p>
<p>Emily had died some hours earlier and my wife, Pat, and I drove my son John Dempsey to visit Emily's remains at the home of Darin Murphy in Ruston. Emily's remains were in bed in a small room off the living room and after viewing the remains Pat suggested we give the two of them some time alone.</p>
<p>Darin said, &quot;Sure we can talk out on the porch.&quot; We all went out to the porch where we stood silently for about 20 min. watching the neighbor’s construction project and doing very little talking. After about 20 min. of standing there, I looked at Pat and said, ”Perhaps somebody should go in and check on John.&quot;</p>
<p>Darin immediately folded his arms across his chest, bowed his neck and said, &quot;I wish you wouldn't!&quot; The move was sudden. The anger was real and we both looked at him like he had totally slipped over the edge. He seemed to realize that he had somehow been inappropriate and he immediately began shaking his head and saying, &quot;That's not what I meant. We continued to look at him as if he were plainly nuts and I said, “It's your house you can do whatever you want to.&quot;</p>
<p>The environment was charged with tension as we waited and after a couple of minutes he finally said, &quot;Yes, why don't you go and check on John?&quot; Pat went back into the house and a couple of minutes later appeared with John we walked to the car and left.</p>
<p>I would suggest anyone dealing with Darin Murphy treat him with the utmost respect as he is volatile and appears perpetually angry.</p>

<p>I don’t know who wrote this. Maybe Darin did:</p>
<p>John is welcome to attend the interment, we would prefer that his father (Herb) and step-mother (Pat) not attend. His other family members (mother, brothers, sisters, etc. are welcome to attend the interment also. We would like John to minimize physical contact with Chloe if he attends.</p>
<p>We would prefer that John and his family not attend the memorial service and other family activities that will follow the interment on Tuesday.</p>
<p>And Alece added:</p>
<p>Additionally, the family is aware that you want to go to the internment, and that is fine with them. They do not, however, want Herb or Pat to attend because there has been some type of &quot;run-in&quot; this week with Herb and Pat. I have no idea what they are talking about and Pam said she didn't either.</p>
<p>Of course Chloe wept with me, in my arms, like normal people do.</p>
<p>And Candace Zygar? In her declaration to the court, she makes statements easily contradicted by over 150 pages of visit reports.</p>

We will be at the Disneyland Park from opening to closing (usually 6am to 10pm or 12am) every day from the morning of the 23<sup>rd</sup> to the evening of the 25<sup>th</sup>. Here is a link to the park schedule <a href="https://disneyland.disney.go.com/calendar/#/default/2014/05" class="uri">https://disneyland.disney.go.com/calendar/#/default/2014/05</a>. Checkout from the hotel is on the 26<sup>th</sup> at noon however, we will probably call for a late checkout to let the kids play at the pool for a little bit to get them worn down for the long ride home.</p>
<h2 id="trip-home">Trip home</h2>
<p>The trip home will begin at approximately 1800 (6pm) on the 26<sup>th</sup>. Jeanette will drive first for 6 hours (while Daryl sleeps), Daryl will take over at this point for 8 hours of night driving (Bettina and Jeannette sleep).

<h1 id="in-seattle">In Seattle</h1>
<p>In Seattle, Chloe and I maintained friendships, including one with Daniel Masler, M.A., L.M.H.C.A., a child psychotherapist.. I organized many hours of play therapy with Mr. Masler. During therapy I learned Chloe felt anxiety about her future security. About that time, Chloe asked me to write a story called &quot;Chloe and John's Future Together&quot;.</p>
<h1 id="jack">Jack</h1>
<p>My step-father since I was 7, Jack Ockfen, said each time I saw him last year that he was praying for me and Chloe. He never saw her since Emily died because Donna has routinely prohibited all adult members of my family from seeing Chloe. The court has failed Chloe's need to see Jack Ockfen, who she called grandpa, who appeared as her grandfather in the News Tribune obituary under his photograph. Who else among her relationships in my family will never see her again?</p>
<h1 id="darins-sabotage-and-abuse-made-emily-furious">Darin’s sabotage and abuse made Emily furious</h1>
<p>In San Francisco, in November, I said I would perform Chloe's adoption &quot;transparently&quot;. Then Darin disappeared to Mexico for December. By January the adoption was in-process. During the 2nd adoption meeting, Darin accused me of sinister intentions, and said sarcastically, &quot;Transparently?!&quot; I think that was something that set him off. The Will Codicile was signed on the same day as the 2nd adoption meeting. The fact Emily revised her will also seemed to be some kind of betrayal to Darin, by me.</p>
<p>Let me confirm one thing: Emily was very, very angry at Darin's behavior. She was angry when he crashed her adoption, she was angry when they asked questions about her will, she was abused by them for her decision, and she called it abuse, and harassment. She would yell, &quot;I'm the one with cancer!&quot; She said she objected to the &quot;harassment&quot; from Darin 's home, including his mother, who called Emily's voicemail, said Emily and grandma had to &quot;get Chloe in a room and tell her it's ok to talk about the ongoing sexual abuse.&quot; We both knew evil was brewing at Darin's house, but let me explicitly state: It made Emily mad. When Adult Protection Services came, Emily was immobile, but she thought Darin called them. She pulled me close, and swore, which she never did, in a voice that is a growl: &quot;Fuck Darin Murphy.&quot;</p>
<p>And so I would do everything Emily's way, because I saw this pattern where she was absolutely furious that her parents were sabotaging her. In fact, when we examined the life insurance, Emily and I both learned it was $400,000 instead of $250,000, and instead of splitting between Donna and Chloe, it was all to Chloe. Everyone had thought it was the smaller amount, split. Darin thought it, Emily thought it, and I have reasons to think Donna thought it, too. But she looked at it, and just said, &quot;Consequences .&quot; I believe she meant to say, &quot;Mom interfered with my plan for Chloe. Consequences.&quot;</p>
<p>In early February, as things kept getting crazier, I told Emily I am loyal to her. I hadn't thought of Darin as an adversary until that winter. He insisted in therapy that I owed him loyalty. But I didn't see him doing what she wanted. You see, early on, he said he was supporting Emily, and asked me what I'm doing. He inspired me to figure that out. I did it very rapidly, because I raced death.</p>
<h1 id="jan-believes-in-emilys-freedom">Jan believes in Emily’s freedom</h1>
<p>Another aspect of this story is my sister, Jan. Everything Jan suggested that I did was like gasoline on this fire. Jan suggested we get a better attorney for Emily's will. Jan kept me focused on Emily, and her wellness, and her happiness. Jan said get a great apartment, it will be your fortress, and she was right. Jan said &quot;Call the police&quot; and that's when Richard blew his top. Everything Jan has suggested--all essentially support for Emily and Emily's clear wishes--has been like gasoline on the fire.</p>
<h1 id="badgering">Badgering</h1>
<p>They would occasionally corner me and demand I explain some or every aspect of Emily's medical treatment. They were often super-hostile about it. I would turn to Emily, who still walked and talked, and be quiet. She could speak for herself, if they would address her.</p>
<p>Once bedridden, Emily told me to be with her when almost everyone was around. Be beside her. To Emily, our home was a source of pride. Her parents' rejection of its sanctity or legitimacy made her very angry. She clearly communicated a wish to live there as long as possible, and clearly fought to keep Chloe with us. When the police interviewed us, I made certain I didn't say much, because Emily was angry. She was also too dizzy to dial 9-1-1 that day.</p>
<h1 id="trust">Trust</h1>
<p>Emily was adamant that dying entails a loss of autonomy and control, and she wanted to be in control of her life as long as possible. This included her plan for Chloe, but a time came where I would try to tell her what was going on, and she didn't understand anymore. She said just that she trusts me. We both trusted each other intensely.</p>
<h1 id="emily-knew-a-lot">Emily knew a lot</h1>
<p>Emily said Darin is &quot;really screwed up&quot; and that she feels sorry for Juan and Fatima. She said Darin carried on sexual relations with the woman who became his second wife, while still with his first wife. Darin was beaten so severely as a child that he was removed from his mother's care.</p>
<p>Emily was the most successful person in her family. She saw what extreme religion in the hands of psychological abusers did to her sisters. She hated it. She wanted Chloe to have more. With my family, she has more. With both families, she has what Emily wanted her to have.</p>
<h1 id="crap-i-wrote-to-joni-once">Crap I wrote to Joni once</h1>
<p>The petitioner has not responded to chemotherapy and is now dying without it. She told me one time why she is staying alive: to see my adoption of Chloe. I now plead with you to consider our application in a thorough but expedited way. Chloe, too, would benefit from the security of additional, active, healthy family who already have welcomed her as ours. Instead she understands me to be dad and &quot;guardian angel&quot; so she understands the legal nuance and is denied more security at a time when she deserves more. Please consider the petitioner's request to see the adoption in person.</p>
<p>I take care of Emily and Chloe full-time. Emily is very weak. She would benefit from a specific dated event to look forward to in the adoption of her child. I welcome a detailed evaluation, but delay makes me profoundly sad, because I know I am insanely committed to Chloe, and may be approved to adopt her some day, but I want Emily to be there. All apologies if I stayed in Seattle too long. I earned money I spend now as I care for Emily and Chloe. They were never far from my thoughts for years and years. I am giving Chloe every security I can find, actively choosing a most appropriate new school, and 3 therapy programs. I spend my days with Emily, who can hardly stand, and now has great fears. I want her to have something to live for, and she already told me what that is: Chloe's security. A dated event would benefit both Chloe and Emily. The county should consider the unique details of this petition.</p>
<p>In January Emily told me why she is staying alive: To see Chloe safely in my custody. I am seeking a dated event, most ideally a court appointment, which Emily would be inclined to live for.</p>
<h1 id="ive-struggled-to-summarize-the-problems-here">I’ve struggled to summarize the problems here</h1>
<p>Donna and Darin use guilt and shame on children. These are powerful but very destructive tools. I believe Donna learned these behaviors through her church, and as a victim of spousal abuse. During a Dempsey family vacation in Long Beach, WA, Emily described Donna to Herb Dempsey as &quot;a punching bag.&quot; In my own training as a volunteer with Flying Colors theraputic childcare, a program for socially delayed children operated by Martin Bullard Ph.D. I was trained specifically to avoid shame as a control tool. Shame is brutally effective but extremely harmful to self-esteem of a child, and causes loss of independent initiative. Excepting Sergeant Emily Murphy, none of Donna's 3 other children have attained any post-secondary degree in any subject. One does not work and the two others work for low wages in retail environments. I have a Bachelor of Arts degree and successful career in computer software. Emily is acutely aware of the value of supportive and healthy emotional behavior on outcomes and she and I spoke many, many times about the pre-conditions for Chloe to seek and earn a post-secondary education.</p>
<h1 id="great-ways-im-peculiar">Great ways I’m peculiar</h1>
<p>Written from Tacoma: I prefer to aquire much smaller living arrangements in urban areas with much more opportunities for activities outside the home. I change residences when my needs change. Our current home is one block from Wright Park, Tacoma's premier urban park where Chloe and I play every day. Emily and I chose this location for its many activities, entertainment, and dining options in walking distance. It also features two hospitals, and a territorial view of Tacoma's waterfront. It's true we could rent or buy more square footage further away from these amenities, but Emily has not driven since her seizure, and foot and wheelchair access has been very valuable to us.</p>
<h1 id="the-moment-i-really-started-spitting-science">The moment I really started spitting science</h1>
<p>I earned money in Seattle over the years Chloe was young and Emily was independent. We spent weekends and family trips together. Now Emily and Chloe need me more than ever, so I came, and live off money I earned over the years of their love and support. I'm not rich. This choice has cost a quarter of my net worth. But it's money I earned in Seattle with their ongoing affection and support. It's money I happily spend now on them.</p>
<p>All the acrimony was a ploy to sabotage the adoption. Emily's father can produce fearful statements faster than people can evaluate them. That's his game: Create the sounds of a crisis when he disagrees, so he can change the outcome. He has succeeded at it with you so far. That's creating a travesty for Chloe.</p>
<p>These months with them both have been hugely challenging, as Emily became paralyzed. I have managed her affairs. Her father only says she's rummy in the head because he disagrees with her choices. 4 attorneys and a psychologist have worked closely with her to evaluate her ability to make adult decisions. None have expressed any concerns. Please consider our conclusion that Emily is sound-minded and in possession of good judgment. She does not want her father to sabotage her exceptionally good choices.</p>
<p>So he'll get worse. His pain is losing control, but his tools are showing &quot;feelings&quot; about how it's my fault. He thrashes and gnashes. Everything he says is bait. The goal of the bait is to draw me (or his family members) into a bottomless pit of twisted up motives and endless guilt and shame. He desperately wants to insert his kooky explanations into the discussion. (Gaddafi said the kids were on Al Quida and Ecstasy.) When this fails, he becomes desperate.</p>
<p>When I first told him I would adopt C, he was supportive! He was a bit abusive regarding not marrying E, but supported the adoption. I think moving E out of his control (in his ex-wife's house) I started freaking him out, so he constructed very intentional crazy explanations of why E is in danger. C is just a chip in all this. But he tried to sabotage the adoption of C to counter-attack regarding E. None of it worked at all. Just as with the dictators! They rachet up the violence because it's all they know how to do, and they blame the victims. They don't feel pain for killing all they kill, including innocent kids.</p>
<p>I have attached my Will, written in 2004, and two letters we've written to help Chloe. No one else has appeared to protect her. Emily's friends and sisters come, and my family comes. My family is already completely committed to raising Chloe with me. I understand there are necessary due dilligences and a &quot;process&quot; and that I've been accused of horrible crimes in that process. Please examine me! Visit my home and evalute my family life while it's still here. Because Emily is disabled, I am raising Chloe. There are profound psychological reasons adoption would make Chloe more secure, and she speaks with longing for the day she is my child.</p>
<p>Today E fell and I had to take the house apart with an hour of heavy work to get her into a bed. In a way I don't mind because I like staying active. But it makes my hands hurt. I have housework tendenitus or something. Washing dishes helps. Since I had to go crazy with every mattress in the house, and take the foots off the ottoman, my office is empty so i've cleaned the floor and will steam clean tomorrow. Even on days where I do hard battle against death and suffering, I still get in laundry and steam cleaning. C is sleeping on the shorter ottoman next to E in a twin mattress. I am maintaining performance in this setting, humor, dining, and a growing number of relationships with medical professionals. C learned to climb mom's stability bar to the ceiling.</p>
<h1 id="everything-emily-said-shame">Everything Emily Said Shame</h1>
<p>Donna often seems derailed by guilt and blame feelings toward herself and others. After spending time with Donna, Chloe repeats complex, troubling explanations of guilt and shame she claims to feel, and asserts that I should also feel. She often cries while explaining why she and others are victims and prepretators of shame patterns. Eventually after returning from Donna's care, Chloe escapes these twisted explanations after crying briefly.</p>
<h1 id="unsent-crap-to-darin">Unsent crap to Darin?</h1>
<p>The most notable thing Emily said to me tonight is that she thought you and Donna would be happy for her. I've thought about it, and can only decide that Emily is the one who betrayed you. We want you to be certain that we have a healthy, beautiful home. So why would you go jockin chaos on that thought? Well, because you're very afraid of what could be up. But Emily is healthier now than a month ago. Everyone we spend time with says so. Emily is very alert, acutely conscious, and steadfast in what she wishes. She has highly sound legal representation and a clear plan. She drives everything about Chloe. I just love them both. But Emily is the one who &quot;betrayed&quot; your home and Donna's.</p>
<p>Emily's dad continues to operate in troubling ways, and say troubling things. My exercise continues to be avoiding his crazy statements, not getting drawn into them. I wish things were quite different but I realized he's bothering Emily, not just me, and so I hope his things improve with Emily... it's not something I can address. That's a piece of the whole patriarcial pie, ignoring the woman, and I won't do it. Like today he said he worries that Emily's needs aren't being met. Isn't she supposed to evalute that? And could he ask her? And the reality is, Bill, I've organized a lot for Emily's needs. Her health, her wishes, her finances, her will. I've committed my life to raising her child. To deal with some guy saying he thinks Emily's needs aren't being met, saying it to her face, like she's a simpleton or child, is a lot of crazy to grapple with.</p>
<h1 id="you-know-what-screw-sara">You know what? Screw Sara</h1>
<p>Emily hates the idea of Sara raising Chloe more than I do. We both hate it a lot. It's condemning Chloe to poverty. Yes, Sara's husband is a student in a PhD program. Eventually he might be a history professor. Emily can't stand how distant is he from his 3 kids, and still wants 1 more. Chloe looks up to Sara's daughter Allie who was sexually assaulted and has sexually engaged with Chloe. There are severe reasons we both are distressed by this idea of Chloe moving to Pullman with her sister's family. Only Chloe likes this idea, because she does not understand how terrible a role model Allie is.</p>
<h1 id="donnas-mom-was-remarkable">Donna’s mom was remarkable</h1>
<p>Alice Manning was Donna's mother. Prior to Alice's passing I visited her with Chloe and Emily at Alice's apartment, attended Emily's college graduation with Alice and Chloe, and played piano at Alice's birthday party in Seattle. I sought to visit Alice in hospice but Emily said Alice was gravely ill and should not be disturbed. I missed the memorial for Alice Manning due to another committment, but with Ch</p>
<h1 id="unsent-letters-to-darin">Unsent letters to Darin</h1>
<h2 id="before-i-knew-darin-was-insane-id-try-to-reason-with-him">Before I knew Darin was insane, I’d try to reason with him</h2>
<p>to Darin (unsent): Emily has said some shocking things since your last discussion with her. She has described the broader relationship with you as harmed by the divorce but restored by your support through her illness. She has said many times that in your last discussion (before leaving for Mexico) you said not just that you disagree with her choice for Chloe, but that her choice shows she lacks competency, the basic skill to choose. She connects this to the divorce, saying the feeling of being ripped apart is the same.</p>
<p>Emily is drafting her new estate plan. I am Chloe's guardian and trustee, and a new section called Power of Attorney for Child is needed. But you did more than express disagreement when you spoke with her. You said her position implies she's not competent to make these decisions. This resulted in a considerable loss of trust. If she does not trust you, how can she designate you in any role?</p>
<p>I think you've been misreading my role for a long time. Again, I wasn't present at your last conversation with Emily, but you might have attributed brainwashing to me. Brainwashing involves breaking people down. I came to Tacoma based on lengthy negotiations with Emily about Chloe's future. But it was a single day of attacks by Donna and you that made me realize I had to find a new home for Emily. I could see her very low mood, and I could see that time with me improved it. I attribute those attacks to grief and fear, and I understand the depth of these feelings. But they are a terrible source of leadership.</p>
<p>Emily is emotionally further along than anyone else. I admire her drive. She says she has no choice but of course she could just weep. Instead she soldiers on. She said yesterday, &quot;I think I'm staying strong so I can finish this plan for Chloe.&quot;</p>
<p>One thing we came to realize together: I am an option. I'm not perfect, the situation is not perfect. When Donna says I'm too old (huh?), does she have a better idea? When you list your criticisms, do you have a better idea? Maybe you do, but you've never expressed it. Maybe you just want a piece of Emily close by. But Chloe and I have a substantial and growing relationship, and I am accompanied by substantial family support. Emily considers me Chloe's best opportunity for security and growth in the future. It doesn't turn all our relationships into solid gold. It doesn't answer all questions about the future. But it is at this point a very solid conclusion. If you maintain criticisms, you must present her with a better option. I had thought your home was a great choice. She did not see the difference between you and Donna. Neither were her first pick anyway. I am. She has told me many times that I'm the only option.</p>
<p>If we were a comic book duo, you'd be TuffGuy, and I'd be NancyBoy. We have very different approaches to challenges. You see black-and-white, and I see shades of gray. You commit to big steps and I take tiny ones. You claim you can compartmentalize your feelings, and I just ride the waves.</p>
<p>None of those musings matter. It matters whether Emily trusts you to carry out roles According To Her Wishes. By saying she lacks competence to decide Chloe's future, you have made her think your support is conditional, and subject to your veto. You have a short period of time to regain her trust.</p>
<p>I predict lashing out and badgering because the situation is not under your control. I hope you give up on that motive and those tactics. People tell me that's where I'm dreaming.</p>
<p>Emily's will is strong. Without her ongoing support I would not be in Tacoma. Most of the fears I had before the move are gone now. I think they were rational and fair, but also based on unknowns. I have many unknowns, but now also many knowns. We are united. We are open about how we feel, and why we are here. If you'd like to shake me off, you will fail. If you'd like to boss anyone around, you will fail. If you'd like to regain Emily's trust, I wish you all the success in the world, because you are not needed, but your help and support are very much wanted now and in the tough times to come. Please hear that: You are not needed. The bully tactics, the badgering, the emotional karate crap ... as protective as you wish to be, if you don't accept and support Emily's most substantial wish--that of choosing the life for her daughter--then she rejects the rest. Spend time speaking with her, and come to understand her, and decide whether you can support her wishes. Only then can you regain her trust.</p>
<h2 id="another-letter-darin-never-got-written-rather-early-on">Another letter Darin never got, written rather early on</h2>
<p>Thanks for expressing your concern about the elevator at Park Tower. I relayed your concern to Emily. She would like you to speak with her directly about any concern you have about her well-being.</p>
<p>I would like to bar the windows shut with tension beams as soon as possible. Please suggest places in town I might find these.</p>
<p>There are quite a few more things on my mind, and I'd love to work more closely with you, but there seems to be a disconnect between you and Emily that isn't something I can fix. She wants you and Donna to be happy for her, because she is doing what she wants. She is very happy in our new home. I can't fix the disconnect because it's not mine. I have come to believe you feel bottomless sorrow, and know you experience paranoia. I know this makes you erratic and a challenge to trust. But what I think doesn't matter. What Emily thinks should matter a great deal to you. And she's annoyed and dismayed. Considerable trust you earned since her diagnosis was shattered when you expressed your objection to me as Chloe's father, just before you left for Mexico. It was not that you disagreed, but she said you also described her as incompetent and under the spell of brainwashing. Trust takes a long time to build and a short time to destroy. I was astonished that her considerable respect for you was crushed so quickly. But you need to understand that I have been her preference for Chloe for a long time. I took a great deal of time to come around, and only do so with considerable support from my own family. It's a paranoid mis-appraisal if you think I persuaded her. Based on your statements to me, I know you experience paranoia. I know your considerable regard for Emily and lack of information reaching you must contribute to your fearful explanations. But I also know if you think I'm engaged in any crazy shit like brainwashing, there's nothing to discuss.</p>
<p>Still, I continue inviting you over. I want to feed you all the answers, like a cheater on a test. I want you to regain Emily's trust. Emily wants you and me to work more effectively together. I think a chasm has formed between us. And it may be impossible to bridge that. I don't naviely expect the mutual regard we once held as friends. I solely hope to protect Emily and Chloe. If you want to participate with me, you need to escape some ideas you've developed. For example, you must engage with Emily just as I do, when evaluating what she wants. It's not &quot;guy talk&quot; when she's an adult. It's incredibly harmful to her trust for you when you suggest she lacks competency. She got a dictionary and looked up the term. She's sensitive to quips and one-liners, especially when she wants to talk more deeply. Maybe you should just visit more often, even just five minutes before work. If you devolve into bossypants McYeller, then don't bother. I want to repair relations even if i think your fears and pain make you erratic. I won't break my nuts trying. I have no additional fealty to offer you. I tried deference to you as Emily's father, but that was a dumb idea. Still, I am a competent adult, just like Emily, and just like you, so I don't understand how a situation you care so deeply about can be governed by such sugar-coated, naive notions like: We just want square footage. We want a lot more than square footage from our home. And I feel longer conversations hold all the promise. You can't exert a lot of leadership with me through short comments. That alone might disqualify us from working together.</p>
<p>I think it's good that Donna got to express her concerns to the adoption coordinator. Repairing relations with Donna and putting her mind at ease about her relationship with Chloe are two important goals of mine. Joni asked Emily if she wanted Joni to communicate with you and Donna further, and Emily said no. She said it was a mistake. Emily has been remarkably consistent in what she wants. It's not what Donna wants, and who knows what you want. I derive a huge amount of strength from Emily's support. Joni had already decided how to evaluate me prior to hearing from you, and her decision has not changed. But listen! When you or Donna fail to accept and even appreciate what Emily wants, THAT MAKES EMILY ANGRY. That's what I've wanted you to understand. Emily is very strong, very sane, and very determined to see her wishes honored. She shouldn't have to fight this hard. No amount of witty quips fix the damage you can do with a lapse in genuine regard and support of her wishes. You might have a vast ego telling you you're perfect. It simply isn't complicated: Genuinely support Emily's wishes and you can regain her trust. That is exactly how I gained it. Don't be paranoid. It's simple. She has called you many names, and I've stood up for you. There's exactly one way to win her whole heart back, and that's genuine support for what she wants, for herself and for Chloe. It's liberating to me that Emily drives so consistently and so hard. It helps me know I'm in the right place doing the right thing. You can't crack a foundation like that. And maybe you don't want to, but paranoia and sorrow are powerful. If you love Emily, come by more often, spend a few minutes with her, and see for yourself. Could it make us partners? I struggle to trust charisma and intellect. They can make a cult leader, but real leadership takes more than that. Nor do I know where you stand on Emily's choice for Chloe.</p>
<p>Come by for the tub test! [In the tub test, Emily would get in the tub and Darin would help her get out. We had to do a tub test because Emily became trapped in the tub at the duplex, where we lived in January only. In that tub, her weak side couldn’t help. In our new tub it was fine. But it was hard to convince Darin to come help with this test. What the hell, I remember wondering at the time. I’m telling him how he can help us… and he’s just kind of cranky and stuff, especially toward Chloe.</p>
<h2 id="trying-really-trying-to-help-darin-win">Trying, really trying, to help Darin win</h2>
<p>There's something else I want you to understand. I keep inviting you over because I want to spell it out for you, like a cheat sheet, the answers to the test, because I want you to pass the test. And this is the answer: The trust and regard you have with Emily rapidly deteriorates when her decisions are not honored. Trust is hard to build and easy to destroy. The most infuriating pattern to Emily is a lack of regard for her choices. At this point she wishes and dreams that her choice for Chloe would be met with support. She wishes Donna was happy for her. We have come forward from the point where both you and Donna were attacking me. The scope of your attacks caused Emily to lose substantial trust. The scope of your attack caused me to realize your sorrow mixes with your paranoia to make you erratic and unreliable. No amount of winks and smiles and one-liners fix that. Trust is hard to earn and easy to destroy. I know that any serious discussion with you probably rolls around to you asserting authority which you certainly don't have over me any longer, in terms and tones that just don't persuade me.</p>
<p>One of the things Emily wants is much better cooperation between Donna, you, and me. I've come to Tacoma and made my home for my family, immediate family. I've done so after Emily's repeated requests.</p>
<p>I want to relay something to you that I've We have worked iwth many I know I can be helpful giving you background or context to issues we face, such as the bath tub or the recent MRI review, but I encourage you to always ask Emily first when you have a concern about her.</p>
<p>I wish we worked more effectively together.</p>
<p>Emily and I hold the lease on this apartment. We are happy here. But if you persuade her to move, of course I'll agree.</p>
<h2 id="unsent-letter-to-darin">Unsent letter to Darin</h2>
<p>The reason I always, each and every time, suggest you come over and talk with me, is because I want to tell you how this all seems from Emily's perspective, and precisely why she's angry. Tonight she said, &quot;I wish my parents were happy for me.&quot; That really gets at the heart of why she's upset. People are done treating her like an adult. And all I do is treat her like one. Betrayal is disrespecting her and her choices. She feels betrayed. Ask her.</p>
<p>I don't think Donna can, but I know you can.</p>
<p>I know you have three-word replies. I know I'm the easy target that lets everyone avoid how she feels. And it just gets more sinister with so much paranoia blending with sorrow. I can't fix you or what's going on. It's drama, and it's a sink-hole, and I'm sad you are falling down the hole, with your mom and your ex-wife and everyone. But the insult, which occurs over and over again, is that Emily is not listened to and respected. And so I listen to her and respect her. And that's a good thing. I, too, wonder why you aren't happy for us.</p>
<p>Thank God I have a strong family who is happy for us.</p>
<p>If you can't help our home, leave us alone! But help to you means helicopter in, get Emily in a car while you run errands, and talk at her. Not listen. She came home so upset. If you saw her more regularly, you would see how she used to be so upset, and now gets to have a healthy emotional life. But you, in your dire fears, think it's all opposite of that. You don't think she's clear-minded when she is. You don't respect her adult choices. And so you have terrible ideas about what's going on.</p>
<p>I can't fix it. But I can start calling the bullshit. And it won't change your sorrow. But betrayed is what Emily felt since your conversation with her prior to leaving for Mexico. I hope you can repair it. I want to map it out like giving you the answers to the test. Perhaps that won't happen. You walk away. Everyone walks away. Nobody talks to Emily but me. You can change that in a snap. By LISTENING to her. Face-to-face, using time. There is no reason you should feel like you're losing her one moment before she's really gone. There's a prison you made up. Make an answer for her: Why aren't you happy for her? Because crazy fears are in charge, right? Right.</p>
<p>I am a convenient distraction for you.</p>
<p>At this point, no member of my family and no personal friend of mine has been contacted for any reason by any investigator, even after three investigations by CPS and one by APS, so I like talking about how closely I coordinated every single hard choice I made with a broad group of healthy, helpful, wonderful people. Emily Murphy invited me to raise Chloe and after considerable consultation unlike any I’d experienced before, I accepted fully and acted accordingly.</p>
<h2 id="andrea">Andrea</h2>
<p>Em said only Darin could stand Andrea. She is pretty insufferable.</p>
<p>His mother, Andrea, is my primary accusor in your letters, now exhibits. She specifies two different dates of a sexual assault in that letter. I wasn't in Mexico on either date. But she's so sure of dates, she says.</p>
<h2 id="says-he-loves-truth">Says he loves truth</h2>
<p>Something always seemed strange at house. Illicit. Accusations of lying were feared. Punishment for lying were severe. Emily warned me not to lie to Darin. Yet everything Darin did in this case And the adoption meeting was lying. In a calculated manner he intended to deceive authorities and the court.</p>
<p>Two videos of Darin for your review:<br />

Wants to be liked. Technical. Charismatic. Wants control, even over severe pain! Really interested in all the computers and information equipment. Even the rules governing information, and going to jail, come up.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love my dad, but he's really screwed up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You never get to know how he really feels. He only shows you what he wants to show you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily said when Darin divorced Donna, his choices felt like &quot;tearing&quot; inside her. But he redeemed himself with Emily by working hard over many years to keep her alive. His rejection of her plan for Chloe--no, his active, very underhanded sabotage--made her very angry again, with the same feeling as when they divorced. &quot;Like tearing.&quot;</p>
<p>Emily said losing independence was the worst part of actively dying, and she insisted on being in charge as long as possible. For Darin to actively undermine her plan for Chloe made Emily very angry. She wanted her parents to be happy for her, and support her choices. Instead they tried to make her into Victimized Vulnerable Brain Damaged Damsel.</p>
<p>At parenting class we studied conflict. They had lots of tips and plans and approaches. It occurred to me in class that Darin does the opposite of the right thing in conflict. If it's not going his way--especially if he's not in control--he wants to up-end the situation with uproar, confusion, fear, more conflict. And apparently he can't stop.</p>
