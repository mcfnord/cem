<h2 id="light-years">Light Years</h2>
<p>I've used hammers made out of wood<br />
I have played games with pieces and rules..<br />
I've deciphered tricks at the bar...<br />
But now you're gone,... I haven't figured out why...<br />
I've come up with riddles... and jokes about war...<br />
I've figured out numbers and what they're for...<br />
I've understood feelings.. and I've understood words...<br />
But how could you be taken away?...</p>
<p>And wherever you've gone...and wherever we might go...<br />
It don't seem fair...today just disappeared...<br />
Your light's reflected now,... reflected from afar...<br />
We were but stones,... your light made us stars</p>
<p>With heavy breath,... awakened regrets...<br />
Back pages and days alone that could have been spent,<br />
Together... but we were... miles apar...t<br />
Every inch between us becomes light years now...<br />
No need to be void,... or save up on life...<br />
You got to spend it all.....</p>
<p>And wherever you've gone... and wherever we might go...<br />
It don't seem fair...you seemed to like it here...<br />
Your light's reflected now,... reflected from afar<br />
We were but stones,... your light made us stars</p>
<p>And wherever you've gone... and wherever we might go...<br />
It don't seem fair...today just disappeared...<br />
Your light's reflected now,... reflected from afar...<br />
We were but stones,... your light made us stars</p>
