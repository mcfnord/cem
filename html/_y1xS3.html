<p>People who came to my bbq: Emily, abraxael , gomezticator , Walter, Michael Dobbie, echoeversky (with two chicks), Aaron &amp; Mugay, Rob &amp; Melissa. So Walter, Bill, and Mugay could get some real philosopho-art chatter going, Dobbie snacked and lounged well (including the hammock), Eric ran the grill, Emily prepared the meat and taco fixings. Melissa and Rob made smores. Summary: Yay!</p>

<p>Feeling completely looney. Listening to the birds. Crying from all kinds of things. I'm gonna snap. My eyes are so irritated. Crying is the best way to relax.</p>
<p>I'm so weak and so full of myself, too. At least lately. I have been a tool. Barely bangin it along. Weekends are the only grace in my life. All the rest: Strife. First World Strife.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> After some crazy laughs with Aaron and Noodle, a bath, and some sweet oral hygene (but not floss) I feel a lot better and wanna just relax as a party brews in the street right below my wide-open window. I've powered off my computers. Soon I, too, will power off.</p>

<p><strong>Let's Take Chloe to New York City</strong></p>
<p>Listen. I am mad about Chloe. I think she's super. She sorta weighs down options. But she would be with great people there. It will be great and fine without her along, and we will have a New York sort of nimbleness. But I could pay for half her ticket, because I think we wouldn't miss out on much. We could find babysitters I am sure. We could show her things like train rides over rivers and sky scrapers and street entertainers and art.</p>
<p>I think about both of you. In the morning I felt something touching my feet that could only be little Chloe. I don't know why anyone would leave her behind. I don't think she would weigh us down too much. And me, I have seen New York. She hasn't. So what if she's 2. She'll remember. The creaking, shrieking subway ride. I love taking friends to new places I love. You two are my friends. They're Jews. Successful and adorable Jews with a big house and healthy habits. They already have two kids who will dote on Chloe. Let's take her, ok?</p>

<p>I'm yawning to the first degree. Today in the morning Emily, Chloe and I went to breakfast with Melissa. I think I was tired at the git go. I sent them off on a trip and then Chloe spent the day with me. Overall it was totally fun. We watched lots and lots of <em>Pingu</em>, just laying in bed, which meant I could half-sleep successfully. I wondered if all those episodes of gibberish-talking penguins would make her eyes glaze, like I felt as a teenager after television marathons, but really they convey so many social scenes and I think she was learning. I'm not a big fan of learning t.v. shows. If they're not awesome like Pingu as legitimate art, screw 'em.</p>
<p>Then we went to the cafe'. She rides with me on the bicycle and everyone coos as we pass. I can't imagine a safer, easier, faster way to go. At the cafe' Chloe really wanted to play the mouse game (Mousetrap) but I know that game is not fun, so I got her to play with go pieces (black and white stones), and pencils for drawing. We also took some goofy nonsensical passes at the Sorry board game. She tried citrus tea and found it satisfying. We then ate a grilled cheese sandwich.</p>
<p>At home we watched more <em>Pingu</em>. Between episodes of <em>Pingu</em> she began poking me in the eyes. WTF, toddler? So I'd stop the video and hold her and demand some answers about the eye-poking, but she'd defiantly arch and parry with nonsense inquiries or distractions, or perhaps a fake crisis. None of it flew and she knew it. Eventually she stopped doing this crazy stuff with my eyes.</p>
<p>There were other instances where she was trying to bust my chops but generally I shut her down and now she often thinks twice. I remember delivering some swats because she wouldn't let go from the railing and it's not safe. Maybe it's instinct and I should just wait her out? Anyway, there were like 3 other swats but not tear-worthy. It wasn't that she got to the railing, but when I was pulling and telling her to let go, she had a defiant smile while meanwhile I made sure she didn't fall to her death. I guess a lot of kids try to determine which &quot;stop&quot; orders they will honor, preferably none. I take her aside a lot and remind her what stop means when I say it. None of these things she's doing are unusual or even rare. It's just necessary to establish and maintain authority against the enormous will to dominate adults and nullify their commands.</p>
<p>I tried to convince her to eat some salad, but what a whiner she became. I called her a sissy. She eventually ate a hotdog with black beans, with apple juice and finally for the evening, warm milk. At one point I busted out a bowl of assorted chips and she complimented me on my entertainment saavy.</p>
<p>Throughout the day I cleaned house, so her grandma wouldn't diss on me. She arrived at 9pm and Chloe's now gone.</p>
<h4 id="teach-chloe-to-use-the-toilet">Teach Chloe to use the toilet</h4>
<p>No poops scored. I underscored the innovative Win Chocolate program, and she's really enthusiastic about the idea of winning chocolate, but she did not translate a waste signal into cocoa goodness. Instead she just dreams of chocolate and figures sitting on the toilet must be connected to that or worth a try for some other reason, which breeds frustration because no waste, no win. Pee is really the loser here, and she has no connection of pee with anything but warm diapers. A Twix awaits in the freezer.</p>

<p>Oh yes Chloe and I were riding from the park on 50th and Meridian, and she was laying her helmet down on the handlebars, first this way then that way... and eventually she just went limp. Yep, fell asleep on the ride home. She was stable but I didn't trust her hands to hold on so I just held her with one hand.</p>

<p>Chloe has picked up this whiney, bossy inflection. If you heard it, you would recognize it. A lot of kids talk like that. I can't stand it. So when I hear it I mock the tones and generally refuse to hear them. She's been a bit hard to convince, but she showed this weekend that she knows the tone well. How long before she realizes it puts me on strike each time I hear it?</p>
<p>It's like she's convinced life is a matter of bossing some adults around / whining impossibly / downright screaming if those things don't work. And maybe tht's why I bring her to screaming. I put her in timeout like three times for screaming. I'm sick of the damned screaming. Telling her she can scream, sure. I'll put her outside where she can scream. Yeah scream your little head off freak. Outside! She makes this face like &quot;OMG NO WAY I DON'T WANT THAT!&quot; and I'm like well you get to choose, scream and yeah you go outside where screaming is fine.</p>
<p>We went exploring for an hour while her mom studied. We went to the UW parking garage. And to the park.</p>
<p>Her mom wants to move to Seattle. This was not our closest weekend together. I've grown accustomed to fighting through Saturday, the fight is usually how I should commit to a deeper relationship. Except regular fights about that just make me sick. And by Sunday we have some connection and fun, but let's face it she has spun classic desperate guilt or something on me about once a week since we started dating. Sometimes I want to write a how-to guide on the most insufferable behaviors I've endured in relationships. I remember a few totally insane ladies who would verbalize an analysis of every tiny thing I did carried far into the future by scientific extrapolation, classifying as they went about whether this is cementing my place beside them forever (rewarded) or driving us to a hopeless future of aloneness (punished with bitter despairing). She's not those extremes but really she already said the writin's on the wall she ain't no weekend romance so she's gonna break up eventually. That kind of talk. Well, fine. Do yo thing.</p>
<p>I guess if that's how it plays out then that will be that. I'll credit her for seeing the future. But really c'mon try to enjoy what you have. So I shall and she'll walk later because stuff's not sufficient. The only proper answer to these premonitions is OK.</p>
<p>At the restaurant I got in trouble for stealing bacon, I guess I started scowling or looking disgusted. I was I guess. I couldn't stand the mentality that abuses me for stealing a slice of bacon. I said well if I buy the meal than I guess it's all my bacon. I guess there's some subtle angle about teaching her not to take from other people's plates, and preventing others from taking from hers. But I wanted some bacon. And I'm definitely not moving to crazytown where two-year-old people wield the chokehold on the table's bacon. It's not some complex negotiation or begging or <em>quid pro quo</em>, or even relying on the whim kindness of a toddler. It's SHARE THE BACON AND DON'T BE FREAKY ABOUT IT. I guess it hit me so low because I realized I am dangerously close to crazytown where toddlers are deified and adults lick boots even when they buy breakfast. I will not reside in that crazytown. My girlfriend's not a parenting psycho with vastly misguided child rearing views. In fact she apologized for the bacon comment. It's just the sort of thing that terrifies me, that I'm even experiencing it at all, a total loss of good sense with replacement by bad... plus shaming and mocking and disgust. I am terrified of looneys and you bet they drown in that sea of madness. when I realize I'm sitting there being derided for wanting some bacon and simply taking it, i realize crazytown is a place i must never move to.</p>
<p>I guess she wants to underscore how she makes me laugh and stuff and that's true, but really it doesn't feel like she should move closer at this time. Isn't this what it's all about so often? Yes and no. People pushing to move closer and reminding you of their greatness in your life... these are very unsettling signs. Just be great. Don't brag about it. I just hate when someone would &quot;knife the baby&quot; in that way where they have it all planned out and xyz adds up to goodbye. Ok if you're so sure then act. Or are you telling all the truth? Is there still a truth of right now? And are you really willing to choke it for some abstractions and some other levers and grips around my neck? It's kind of insulting and it makes me feel sick, to deal with that kind of pressure, because it is simply not the kind of pressure I accept now or later. My mom wants grandchildren but I want happiness.</p>

<p>We're going to SF Tuesday to see if she has brain cancer again. But don't expect more cool scalp scars... cuz this time it's inoperable!</p>
<h3 id="oct.-15th-2009">Oct. 15th, 2009</h3>
<p>Emily does not have inoperable brain cancer. She just has a common and typically harmless scarring condition caused by her previous chemotherapy.</p>
<p><strong>darin murphy responds:</strong></p>
<p>A minor correction: The scarring is from her previous radiation therapy - collateral damage so to speak. But it is something that can happen and should pose no real problems now that we know what it is.</p>
<p>We are really glad that is what it is, rather than multiple tumors...</p>

<p><strong>2 hours of riding around</strong></p>
<p>Emily did accounting homework while Chloe and I enjoyed bike shopping (but didn't get one) and just exploring up woodsy bike trails around UW. Three or four times today she understood something I explained, and gave me a big hug for it. Like, I explained a few things about letters, and she understood, and it makes her so happy that she just pauses to hug me. I also explained why we weren't doing exactly what she wanted, because we got to do some of it and then had to move on, and I explained that she would need to learn to accept this, which made her super-mad, until I said she doesn't have to learn to accept it right away. Having some wiggle room pleased her a great deal, and she said, I swear, &quot;John, I love you to death.&quot; When I can explain something she's trying to understand, and the idea gets through to her, perhaps it makes her feel connected, like she really can make it in this krazy world. She loves bike riding and it's a chance for us to explore, sing, and converse. There's no question who is in charge (me, obviously) and yet it's all quite fun, riding through empty parking lots and all around trails. I try to keep her cool at the bar in the cafe' where we eat grilled cheese. She can't get that crazy at the bar because she's up so damn high on a stool and it's like gymnastics just to stay safe up there. She didn't get that crazy today. We spent some time singing loudly. I did express that occasionally she's just raving like a bully and not singing at all. She seemed to understand this critique. She likes to yell and take over the airwaves but what's the harmony in that? In the evening, we played with hardly no acrimony, on the bean bag, playing catch, hiding under blankets, watching baby goats, and being carried/swung/lifted in the bucket. For a while we sat in the storm with her in the bucket outside. She likes being carried around in a bucket. We also pushed her in a shopping cart.</p>

<p>I'm going to burnout on my birthday this Saturday. I'm excited, nervous, and stressed. I bought a red apron that looks like a halter top dress and a lazy black and red bra underneath... at KMart! It was cheap and marvelous... now I just got to find some fish net stocking and zipper boots. I've decided to go against the tradition of burning man and not bring things to trade/give to other people. I don't what I'm talking about because I've never been but it's my party that's within the party so... I'mado what I want!</p>

<p>Chloe and I laid on the huge bean bag where she sleeps. It was dark and quiet. The last moments before sleep can feel like sleep, as big eyes make out the contours of the room. We looked in each other's eyes for a minute or more. That never happened before. I saw her trust and hope and joy for living. I hoped it never leaves.</p>
<p>Some people can't or won't look into your eyes. I started asking her to do it when I knew she wasn't listening to something important. Sometimes she'd wiggle for a long time before agreeing to look in my eyes. She knows there's no more screwing around when you're face-to-face and listening.</p>
<p>Through the gaze I saw a few of her usual twitches, leaping off toward some distraction, drama, obsession. This is a large part of being 2. Maybe lost adults are lost in the same ways. But she came back mid-twitch each time.</p>
<p>In the morning she blocked me from exit and demanded that I confirm I'm her daddy. I told her a few times that I'm 'like a daddy'. This time I said I'm a friend. I met her at a young age when words were dripping from her mouth and now they're pouring out. I doubt her daddy would teach her to read, or look in her eyes and see what I saw.</p>
<p>I kept thinking about the lame things that crush hearts and jade people to the world. I imagined her as a teen, and wondered about her gaze then, deep in the crucibles of life. I hope they never jade this graceful gaze of wonder and hope.</p>
