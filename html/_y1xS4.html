<p><strong>This weekend</strong></p>
<p>This was nice, right now I am occasionally yelling at my daughter to 'go to bed!' because she insists on sleeping in my bed. So this weekend was her first sleepover, it was rather fun. We made lots of videos. Figured out my boyfriends room would be perfect for a pole, and found out that certain popcorns are very bad for you sex life. So tonight I prayed with Chloe for the first time in a very long time. It felt good. My mom's arm is getting better so she'll start work again tomorrow, I was feeling depressed when I left BF's house. I guess his enthusiasm was lacking due to popcorn so of course I connected myself with him feeling like crap and said to myself 'he doesn't love me' in a high whiny voice. sigh, get over yourself, self.</p>

<p>on friday eve i clean the whole house knowing emily and chloe are coming to play.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Everyone has a flu or cold. We are lounging on food. I spiked Chloe's grape smoothie with expectorant. She said she loves me, and said, &quot;kiss me, monkey!&quot; Then Emily and me got cozy the bean bag. We're finding it exceedingly unlikely that we'll ditch this pad. But we might check out a place with a view tomorrow. I'm now convinced that I would find a new pad, or find a roommate, and that both outcomes seem possible enough.</p>

<p><strong>Another Speech by Another King: Rodney</strong></p>
<p>People, I just want to say, you know, can we all get along? Can we get along? Can we stop making it, making it horrible for the older people and the kids?</p>
<p>It’s just not right. It’s not right. It’s not, it’s not going to change anything. We’ll, we’ll get our justice.... Please, we can get along here? We all can get along.</p>
<p>I mean, we’re all stuck here for a while. Let’s try to work it out. Let’s try to beat it. Let’s try to beat it. Let’s try to work it out.</p>

<p>Chloe has a barbie backpack and she only carries two my-little-ponies in it, plus a pink comb for their manes. i guess i figured she had something else in there, but that's it. for now.</p>

<p>We went to UW with the blossoming trees. Chloe climbed a tree. I said I'm a square. Emily said she's an octagon.</p>
<p>Chloe likes the word <em>language</em>. She describes the emerging rules around showing her panties as <em>butt language</em>. Exactly right. She ate an apple while watching me sleep. When I woke up, she told me my eyebrows are beautiful.</p>
<p>On to toilet pooping without chocolate incentive. Raising the bar!</p>

<p>Loveyou,</p>
