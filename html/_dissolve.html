<h1 id="vs.">Vs.</h1>
<p>Don't underestimate the power of these people to be hostile, and to subvert. There's a whole ideology at work with them. Darin is a cult leader of his family, Donna is a victim, and uproar, sinister charisma, hostility, chaos, fear, and emotional starvation are the tools. It leads to terrible outcomes for their families. But it keeps Darin in charge.</p>
<p>The assertion that Emily was unsafe in our home began at the first adoption meeting, before the meeting. Later, when she received her death sentence, Donna thanked me for my help but insisted Emily was unsafe. I explained she’s safer with me than at Donna’s home. Darin repeated that the elevator was inadequate. I asked him to affirm Emily had left and returned to the building in the elevator the previous day and he responded aggressively that &quot;I won't argue about this with you John!&quot; Clearly that's true. He just repeated the claim. He didn't make any sound arguments. The assertion that there’s danger is a national anthem in this family. It’s how they manipulate people and situations.</p>

<h1 id="jennifer-murphy-sex-scandal">Jennifer Murphy Sex Scandal</h1>
<p>It took me some time to remember what went on in the 1990's in the family.</p>
<p>The reason I was talking sexually with Jennifer is because the girls always spoke very sexually explicitly with me. That was strange, especially for such an obviously very strict family. They complied with serious strictures, but spoke like sailors, except for Donna. Actually, they wouldn't swear, almost never, but they would talk about sex explicitly. Jenny was as vocal as the rest, and as curious as the rest, which has always been fun (until today!) because Jenny is very conservative and chaste and really always was, the most religious sister by far. She sometimes drank and got high as an adult, but was also drawn to strict moderation. But yep, she always spoke in sexually explicit terms with me and her sisters.</p>
<p>Emily said more than once that the high libido was the &quot;defining&quot; characteristic of a Murphy, the essence of one.</p>
<p>I don't know if you have understood, or need to understand, the whole psychology of Darin Murphy, but Emily said she thought Darin's intense sexuality was an ingredient in this characteristic of the girls. As adults and very young adults, and with Emily over many years, the sisters often spoke of their sexual interest level as very high, and described this as a characteristic of them as a generation in the family. They would say &quot;Murphy girls are horny!&quot; I don't know if you grew up this way, and I did not. I was sexually charged as young people typically are, but I never thought, &quot;Dempsey kids are horny!&quot;</p>
<p>So a decade passes of this, and wham, it leads to frank conversation in a wholly chaste long-term friendship. I danced with Jenny as a child, because I dance. We've danced many times together since. Recently we danced explicitly as adults at a disco, and snuggled platonically together to keep warm in a cold apartment in 2012. Of course I danced at her wedding, too. I know Jenny! As a child and an adult.</p>
<p>The whole family talked sexually. All four girls and basically Darin. I had forgotten about this detail, because it isn't this way anymore. Emily once told me she figured the girls were all this way because Darin had a very high level of sexual energy. Whatever the cause, Murphy girls loved talking about sex with John Dempsey and each other. And TALKING has never felt wrong to me. Never did anyone touch, ever, but I had very sexually specific (not vulgar) verbal relationships with Jennifer, Sarah, Melissa, and (later) Emily, which they initiated and I treated with high respect. That was a long time ago, and I had forgotten about it.</p>
<p>So now I'm off dancing and talking sex with a girl who tries to kiss me!? It was the only time she ever tried. Jenny (famously) said at age five, &quot;Mom, how old will John be when I'm old enough to get married?&quot; Melissa also had a huge crush on me for about a year. I'd be around after dinner one evening, and everyone's gone to bed, but she's beside me, not speaking or touching, just looking at me, very happy. She would clearly appear overpowered by the crush, just gazing on me, kind of paralyzed. I would smile and sit, eventually hug her and go home. I had nothing but high regard and deep affection for these girls. I was in their lives for two decades. Throughout that time, I behaved like the adult I am.</p>
<p>Further, it has never felt like a challenge to demonstrate respect for sexual boundaries with my hands and actions. This was not gray or blurry to me. It would surprise me if any Murphy girl would say I disrespected them at any moment in my life, or sexualized them at any moment of their childhoods. In fact it's my feeling that their socialization as sexual objects for religious causes is a grave harm to them. I was very conscious of their strict religious environment. And I had both then and now a strict moral code against any adult sexualizing a child. We all apparently believed words didn't count. Not explicitly sexualizing them--society does that constantly with girls, and I've known that for a long time--but talking explicitly about sex, including experiences. Murphy girls wanted this kind of conversation all day long.</p>
<p>There's truth, and there's the whole truth. And this story of me and the Murphys most certainly is...</p>
<p><strong><em>F</em></strong>amily</p>
<p><em>L</em>aw!</p>
<h2 id="stalker">Stalker</h2>
<p>Darin emailed me late October, 2004 with many pages of unrequited love letters from Tim, in his 30’s, who sought Jenny’s hand in marriage when she was 16. In this same period I stayed on the bus an extra stop to visit her at home. We both went downtown, her for High School, and me for a job I had there. She and I were there alone at her home together. She mentioned this guy Tim. I asked if she liked him and she said not really. So I said just forget about him, let’s go to the museum together. That’s the flow how it came together. So Darin certainly trusted me enough to give me his teenage daughter’s stalker’s intel file, or that other time he told me Melissa was on crack.</p>

<h2 id="a-letter-he-sent-emily-i-added-bold">A letter he sent Emily (I added <strong>bold</strong>)</h2>
<p><strong>From:</strong> Michael Howard</p>
<p><strong>Sent:</strong> ‎12/‎8/‎2013 9:08 PM</p>
<p><strong>To:</strong> Emily Murphy</p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> RE: Change of guardianship</p>
<p>Dear Emily,</p>
<p>I intentionally did not respond immediately because I am busy with other commitments and I wanted to think about my reply. I also wanted to find out a little more about what you were thinking, hence my mail asking you the three questions.</p>
<p><strong>Shortly after I did your will</strong>, you had the surgery down in California. Almost immediately afterword <strong>your dad contacted me about your desire to change the guardian provisions in your will and make John Chloe's guardian</strong>. Given how sure you were about your guardian decisions before the surgery, this represented a huge shift. I spent a significant amount of time talking to Darin, thinking about your situation and researching the impacts of the type and extent of surgery you had undergone. I also want to be clear that I communicated with your father because you told me it was ok for me to do so.</p>
<p>It was my concern that you did not have testamentary capacity so soon after such a major surgery. I felt that, at a minimum, (1) more time needed to pass for you to become stable post surgery and (2) it was important to get a letter from your doctor clearly stating in writing that you had the mental and emotional capacity to understand and rationally make such a big change and important decision. Without additional recovery time and a doctor's letter, I felt it was not <strong>ethical</strong> to for me to make any changes to your guardian designation at that time</p>
<p>I have recently spoken with both you and your dad again; before your e-mails of this last week. What I came away with was that your medical condition had gotten worse, rather than better, and you were attempting to schedule another surgery. <strong>You told me that you wanted John to be Chloe's guardian</strong>. Then a day or so later Darin contacted me and stated that you wanted to change your guardian designation to he and Mariella. I was told that John had clearly expressed he did not feel he was an appropriate guardian and did not want to be appointed. Then I was told there had been a series of discussions between you, your dad, your mom and step-dad and John over a long weekend and that, based on everyone communicating, it had been decided to leave the guardian designation as drafted in your will.</p>
<p>And now, you contact me again and, again, <strong>John</strong>'s name is on the table. So here is what I believe to be the best course of action. I am not willing to do any work on your guardian designation unless there has been a meeting of everyone concerned and you are all in agreement on who should be appointed Chloe's guardian. By everybody, I mean you, John if he's still part of this picture, your dad and your mom and step-dad. If all of you do not agree on who should be guardian, I will not make any changes unless you have a doctor's letter stating that you have the mental and emotional capacity to understand and rationally make a new guardian designation. If you can document universal agreement of all the involved people or, absent a universal agreement, provide me with a doctor's letter, I will help you. If you have neither an agreement nor a doctor's letter, I am not willing to make any changes to your estate plan.</p>
<p>Yours Truly,</p>
<p>Michael Howard</p>
<h2 id="a-letter-id-like-to-send-him">A letter I’d like to send him</h2>
<p>Dear Mr. Howard,</p>
<p>Hello. I’m appointed to carry out wishes set forth in the will of Emily Rose Murphy, which you prepared. I believe files in your possession specify what Ms. Murphy wished, in concrete language, pertaining to disputed matters. Delivery of these files could only support your client in the settling of her estate. Regrettably, you’re delaying this estate’s closure.</p>
<p>I see parallels with Ms. Murphy’s experience. Your decisionmaking methodology and intentional delay interacting with Ms. Murphy caused her distress and required her to seek replacement counsel to complete estate planning during a painful period of her short life. I’ve attached a germane email thread. Many medical and legal professionals found your insistence on either full group consent or a precise medical determination worthy of criticism. For next time, be aware that the Mini-Mental Status Examination is the proper evaluation tool in this circumstance. I encourage you to donate your $500 fee to the Wounded Warrior Fund.</p>
<p>Your letter dated xx points out that Ms. Cox and I have presented different requests. Ms. Cox can clarify the scope of her information request, which is limited to her fiduciary responsibility. My own query spans all executor agency power. I’ve attached my previous signed request, and clarify its scope here:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Every communication involved in preparing the Estate and Will, including meeting agendas and logs, notes, such as hand-written notes, and a log of all parties present for the procedures associated with preparation of these Estate and Will documents.</p></li>
<li><p>Content and metadata of all emails and calls made to and received from Emily Murphy, and to and from all other parties contributing to the preparation of her Estate and Will in any capacity.</p></li>
<li><p>Emails can be passed to me as a comprehensive digital bundle of all communications both to and from all parties. For telephone calls, please specify the time, duration, and initiant of each call, and summarize each call’s topics and details.</p></li>
<li><p>This request is not limited to services provided prior to Ms. Murphy’s death. Please enumerate all communications involving Ms. Murphy’s estate in your practice both before and after her passing.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The specifics of the wishes of Ms. Murphy on matters now in dispute are of premier importance. I wish to close this estate for its beneficiary, so rush your reply, and I’ll rush mine.</p>
<p>John Dempsey</p>
<p>P.S. I’ve attached the deposition of Darin Murphy, in which you are mentioned.</p>

<hr />
<p>Natalie Dong, Ph.D., ABPP is Director of Center for Polytrauma Care at the Puget Sound Health Care System (V.A.). She specializes in brain injuries. Dr. Dong studied your email (attached) at length. According to Dr. Dong, competency is a legal status, not a medical one. In her view, your relationship with Darin Murphy represented a clear conflict of interest, regardless of Emily Murphy's consent to the relationship.</p>
<p>I am the personal representative who holds the decedent’s attorney-client privilege. the attorney-client privilege lasts as long as a personal representative is in place. It remains effective during the administration of the deceased client’s estate and during the resolution of claims by or against the estate.</p>
<p>attorney-client privilege does not apply to “a communication relevant to an issue between parties all of whom claim through a deceased client, regardless whether the claims are by testate or intestate succession, nonprobate transfer, or inter vivos transaction.”</p>
<p>As the deceased's legal representative the executor has a variety of duties, obligations and powers with respect to the estate and the beneficiaries. In fulfilling these duties and obligations, the executor must be wary of issues and liabilities such as breach of confidence claims, privacy issues, claims of breach of duty in relation to any trust document preventing disclosure and allegations by beneficiaries of a failure to protect the assets of the estate.</p>

<p>If my schedule is likely to result in Sarah, I'd appreciate an opportunity to reschedule.</p>
<p>And reports please.</p>

<p>We are unable to guarantee that a particular supervisor will always be available. Rescheduling visits will not guarantee that a particular supervisor will be available.</p>
<p>What is your basis for not wanting Sarah supervising?</p>
<p>J. Dempsey <a href="mailto:mcfnord@gmail.com">mcfnord@gmail.com</a>, 10/3/14, to CFS</p>
<p>I have quite a few concerns about Sarah. I have a team that reads every report. Here's feedback from one of my team members, a retired police officer, about Sarah's reports:</p>
<p>&quot;As a report it is a complete failure as there is an apparent lack of direction in the report. If the purpose of the report is to characterize the relationship between Chloe and Mr. Dempsey in a supervised setting ('These observations are of parent-child contact which occurred in a structured and protected setting.') there is way too much intrusion by the supervisor (observer making observations) who is in the role of an observer and not as a 'cop.' I taught report writing in the law enforcement academy before the WCJTC took the process under tow. Any cop worth his salary knows his report has a purpose. In my years as a field training officer the supervisor would have been relieved of duty and asked to return to the manual to review some basic principles. When Chloe gets peevish because she doesn’t get her way those in charge must deal with the behavior. The geography of that encounter is completely misunderstood by Sarah. There is never a discussion of either the etiology of the unacceptable behavior or some appropriate supervisory dialogue on how to avoid such situations in the future. She is trying to be important but I suspect nobody has told her what that means.&quot;</p>
<p>The woman who accompanied us at the zoo also trains in report-writing for emergency responders, with about 30+ years of experience. She said Sarah appeared bored, and during a critical emotional incident Sarah kept interfering. Her interventions fanned a negative behavior Chloe has learned from grandma, that of making an uproar by obstruction. The trainer also considered Sarah's attire to be inappropriate.</p>
<p>I am a professional writer. I read most reports many times, but can't read Sarah's. Sarah's reports lack a clear understanding of audience and purpose. They cover irrelevant details and miss important ones. I want to avoid needing Sarah as a witness in the March trial, because I have not seen indications that she could speak to my skill in parenting this child. My particular recollection from the Zoo was when Chloe said, &quot;I would feel so sad if I couldn't see you,&quot; and I wondered quite aloud if that would be in the report. It wasn't. Not every detail is. But the fact I &quot;rode a slug&quot; on the merry-go-round is, and the exact way I carried a cranky Chloe got documented in detail I must call lurid. Call my reaction visceral and subjective, but as a professional writer I feel sick realizing I'm paying for that writing. Meanwhile I fully endorse the report-writing skill of the other 3 supervisors I've worked with.</p>
<p>We considered passing on the reports when she supervises, but since our legal position is transparency we should not pass.</p>
<p>So we schedule further in advance and if I knew both Charlotte's and Sarah's days off I would have even more to work with.</p>
<p>I hope this clarifies.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>John</p>

<h2 id="dec-10-2013">Dec 10, 2013</h2>
<p><strong>From:</strong> John</p>
<p>Hi, Emily.</p>
<p>I still need to do a few things in the Seattle apartment before January.</p>
<p>I talked with Harry and Rachel about my fears and hopes. Of course I fear that things might fall apart. But I should also think about things going well for us 3.</p>
<p>I think it's critical that we build trust. Our relationship is warm and we have fun together. We are friends. We can't just battle when we disagree like we have in the past. We can't just push for changes that don't make sense. We need to listen and communicate. We have to try to cooperate even when we disagree. Drugs and alcohol can make that much harder. Living together better sound like a square and serious challenge, not a party.</p>
<p>I don't support anything crazy. I can't. I can't just jump in the truck and sneak into your house at night. I can't keep you up late. If you are not healthy, rested, and nourished, guess what: You can give doctors doubts. Priorizing lust and making teenager choices can wreck everything. So I am going to be a hardass. I hope you understand why.</p>
<p>There are many goals we must accomplish when we move in together. I Can't Fuck It Up. Like, I could ignore my feelings until they explode. I could fail to build a network of supporters and helpers. You or I could drown in drugs or alcohol. There are plenty of ways to fuck this plan up. We must stay focused on very serious needs.</p>
<p>And there are logistics. I absolutely oppose any junk in the apartment. The space there is for people, not crap. How can we achieve this? It could be wise to throw all your property into a storage unit nearby, and then pull out just the things you find essential. What do you think of that idea?</p>
<p>I look forward to this new chapter in my life. I hope we approach this with honesty and maturity. I know you are excited and that's great. But please size up the very serious aspects, of our emotional needs, our long-term needs, and such. I want us to have fun. The only way we really can is if we are being honest with each other, respecting each other, and building trust.</p>
<p>Love and hugs, warmth and quiet time cuddling, from your friend,</p>
<p>John</p>

<p><strong>From:</strong> John</p>
<p><strong>To:</strong> Nicole Barrett, Madigan Oncology</p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Sgt. Emily Murphy</p>
<p>Hi, Nicole.</p>
<p>The condition of Sgt. Emily Murphy (last 4: 2539) has worsened.</p>
<p>She is much weaker. She has very little stamina. She can only get up sometimes without help. Thankfully she does not fall much, but has fallen due to weakness in the bathroom.</p>
<p>She is very sleepy, but does wake up, especially in the evenings.</p>
<p>Her left hand is now numb.</p>
<p>She lacks bladder control. She also can't pee sitting down so well as when she is standing, which makes trips to the bathroom frustrating.</p>
<p>Her vision is going double (I believe) occasionally, and she cannot focus at these times. At these times she may be prone to nausea and has vomited. She said one eye seems to be bulging.</p>
<p>She reports that she is occasionally &quot;very dizzy&quot;.</p>
<p>Headaches are more frequent.</p>
<p>We have gotten her a walker and a wheelchair. We believe a bar by the bed and perhaps one in the bathroom can contribute to independence.</p>
<p>Tricare has marked the request for in-home occupational therapy as &quot;pending&quot;. We are waiting for this approval.</p>
<p>I will be with Emily in the Oncology department Thursday, April 3rd, at 1:30pm. I hope to see you then.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>John Dempsey</p>

<h1 id="chloe-and-john">Chloe and John</h1>
<p>Milestones: I have been present for her first independent swing ride, first ride down a slide, first full trip across the monkey bars. `at every birthday party since she turned 2, where I typically played a central role operating the pinata and providing gifts and food. I taught Chloe to swim, ride a bike, and use the toilet (with Emily). I was present when her first, second, and third teeth fell out. I have attended every open house for Chloe's school, from pre-school to Kindergarten to First Grade. I have taken Chloe to 4th of July overnight camping every year since she was 3. I have taken Chloe to Christmas Eve overnight at my sister's since she was 3, and consistently attended Christmas and Thanksgiving events in Donna's home. I have taken Chloe and Emily to my brother's daughter's birthday parties at Gasworks Park in Seattle since she was 3. I have been with Chloe during 3 New Years celebrations and 5 family wedding ceremonies. I attended Chloe's only violin recital. At most family events I spend most of my time with Chloe and her mother, Emily.</p>

<li><p>Donna complained to me when I was about 21 that Darin did not spend adequate time with his children, and asked me to discuss it with him. Bettina told me that her dad basically thought Darin was a terrible dad. Ask Bettina to repeat that!</p></li>
<li><p>In 2013 Donna filled a stocking for me for Christmas in their home.</p></li>
<li><p>Carlos, Emily had her doubts about Richard’s parenting <em>bona fides</em>. There was something about a girl he raised until she was 13? Or starting age 13? I’d like to know the details of his relationship with this child or adult child. Where is she now? Does she call?</p></li>
<li><p>Donna accepted the term ‘Dad’ for me around Chloe fairly early on. She only stopped using the term around the time the police came to return Chloe to Emily.</p></li>
<li><p>Around October I asked Donna if she trusted me, and she said she does.</p></li>
<li><p>I sat with Uncle Willy at the wedding of Donna and Richard, and sang karaoke. (Not an actual uncle. I was Uncle John for the 4 daughters!)</p></li>
<li><p>Richard Mairs plays video games and watches home improvement programs a lot on TV. I have only rarely seen Richard leave his recliner, usually for dinner.</p></li>
<li><p>There's something Emily told me about Richard's parenting experience, that it was soft, and/or that he is sort of afraid of children, at least small children, fearing they'd break. Well I understand.</p></li>
<li><p>I’d like to know what video games Richard has played, and what home improvement tasks he has completed in 2015.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="shame">Shame</h2>
<p>Donna often seems derailed by guilt and blame feelings toward herself and others. After spending time with Donna, Chloe repeats complex, troubling explanations of guilt and shame she claims to feel, and asserts that I should also feel. She often cries while explaining why she and others are victims and perpetrators of shame patterns. Eventually after returning from Donna's care, Chloe escapes these twisted explanations after crying briefly.</p>

<p>Here’s Fatima, Darin’s adopted daughter, telling Chloe this photo is beautiful. This is Chloe at my sister Jan’s house for Christmas Eve, where she went every year.</p>
<p>I bet Darin started not liking me right around the Dash Point Park camping trip. That was around 2011 I think. And I suspect Emily was the reason, but Emily’s money became a bigger reason, and then going bonkers became its own reason.</p>

<p>I bring pumkins!</p>
<p>When Emily turned 30, we all ate at Johnny Bahama’s in Southgate Mall. I ate a little and Chloe and I ran around the empty parking lot.</p>
<p>Once Emily cooked salmon at Donna’s and Darin and I ate it.</p>
<p>Darin ate sushi on 6<sup>th</sup> ave with Emily and me pretty recently, perhaps early 2013.</p>
<p>It was 2012 or 2013 when I bought Donna lunch on Broadway in Seattle. It was Thai food. Emily was with us. Donna sold me a fundraiser chocolate bar for Stanley Elementary.</p>
</div>
<h1 id="section-1">2013</h1>
<div id="2013ish">
<p>In Spring, 2013, Donna drove Emily and Chloe to Seattle Center to meet me, and left them with me.</p>
<p>donna invited me to sleep at her house so i could attend the &quot;Ethnic Festival&quot; in the park the next day.</p>
<p>in her kitchen, i asked donna if she trusted me. she said, &quot;call me old fashioned, but an adult man shouldn't take a bath with a little girl.&quot; i told her the bath was 18 months ago, and asked again if she trusted me. she said she did. Later, Donna would call me a child, shattering Emily’s trust. Donna already promised to keep me in Chloe’s life, and yet she called me a child? Emily was pissed.</p>
<p>in 2013, donna loaned her car to me twice, both for overnight camping with emily and chloe. once was 4th of july, for two nights, and once was a month or so later, for one night, at the beach.</p>
<p>Father's day in 2012 or most likely 2013, I had planned to take Chloe to a couple's home in Olympia. No one answered at Donna's home. I called Donna's sister who said Donna was probably at church. On that day, Donna addressed her church congregation about the traits of a good father. I thought Chloe might be with her. I went to Donna's church and found Donna. Donna said Chloe was at Darin's home. I drove to Darin's home to get Chloe.</p>
<p>Later Emily awoke from her nap and called me to say she was energetic enough to join us on the trip.</p>

<h2 id="bridges-happened-consistently-because-i-made-it-happen">Bridges happened consistently because I made it happen</h2>
<p>Since Emily asked me in April, 2013 to attend the monthly BRIDGES: A Center for Grieving Children program, I have attended nearly all monthly programs with Chloe and Emily. Donna Mairs stopped attending BRIDGES regularly in December, 2013. I have never seen Richard Mairs attend the BRIDGES program. How closely are they attending to Chloe's needs now and in the future if they do not attend this critical program for her emotional wellness during this transition?</p>
<h1 id="section-2">2014</h1>
<div id="2014pre">
<ul>
<li><p>January 25<sup>th</sup> at hospital, Donna expressed remorse to me that she had said mean things about me during the 2nd adoption meeting, exclaims, “People say your love is better than mine.” I assure her that’s impossible.</p></li>
<li><p>February, Donna visited our home with one or two of her daughters. Donna said, &quot;thank you for taking care of emily,&quot; and gestured to offer me a hug. I rose from the couch and we hugged.</p></li>
<li><p>I called police twice with regard to the custody of Chloe. The day before the first call to police was April 11, 2014. Donna Mairs (Emily’s mother) picked Chloe up from school but did not bring her home as agreed. I called and she answered but then we were disconnected. Immediately, I called again and nobody answered. Immediately I called again. Donna then asked if Chloe could stay the night, but I declined. I picked Chloe up and returned her home.</p></li>
<li><p>At the start of 2014, Donna explained that the purchase of Richard’s truck was financed based on overtime pay, which had since disappeared.</p></li>
<li><p>Emily told Donna about Emily's plan in January, 2014. Donna claimed I was too old to raise Chloe. Huh?</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="2014post">
<ul>
<li><p>On June 20<sup>th</sup>, 2014, Chloe asked, &quot;Why won't you give back mom's phone?&quot; Chloe explained that someone on Emily's phone had a horse (which I had never heard before, and am not aware of any horse ride previously), and that due to my possession of the phone, she was unable to &quot;ride a horse rather than thinking about mom's death.&quot; I am executor of Emily's estate, with legal obligations that should be clear to the adults involved. Previously Darin Murphy had exerted substantial pressure to gain control of this telephone. I have never received any request for this contact’s information. An adult introduced this explanation to Chloe, abusing her in the conflict while also alienating me from her.</p></li>
<li><p>During the visit to the Puyallup Fair on September 10<sup>th</sup>, 2014, Chloe told me, “Grandma says you aren’t really family.” When I asked Chloe what she</p></li>
<li><p>thinks, she said she was not sure if I am family, but went on to say she wished to reside with me.</p></li>
<li><p>During a visit in Downtown Tacoma, on October 9<sup>th</sup>, 2014, Chloe said Donna had claimed I had voluntarily delivered Chloe to Donna because I was unable to care for her for “that week”. I said that was untrue. Chloe became upset and responded, “Grandma is trying to make me not like you! Why? Why is she doing that?” I told Chloe I did not know, and that she needed to ask Donna why. Charlotte observed and participated in the conversation.</p></li>
<li><p>Donna appears to fear Howard Dempsey, who she knows to be a retired junior high school teacher:</p>

<p>Christine, I had a question about the report on11/23 with Charlotte at the home of Howard Dempsey. Charlotte states that Howard went down stairs to watch sports on TV and Chloe followed shortly after. Mr Dempsey finished cooking the rice and we too returned downstairs. Did she leave Chloe alone with Howard downstairs?. I just want to make sure that Chloe is not to be left alone with anyone while at a visit. Let me know. [Christine’s response:} CFS follows the person being supervised, not the child.</p></li>

<p><br></p>
<h2 id="rejection-of-entire-family">Rejection of entire family</h2>
<p>With the exception of visitations that take place at my mother's home or my uncle's home, Donna repeatedly rejected my requests to have my adult family members share my visitation with Chloe; she even refused to let them transport Chloe for visitation. This includes my father, Herb Dempsey, who is a former police officer and educator.</p>
</div>
<div id="2014pre2">
<h2 id="yelling-at-donna">Yelling at Donna</h2>
<p>The two times in my life I raised my voice to Donna Mairs both occurred in 2014. Emily didn't like it either time.</p>
<p>1) At BRIDGES grief therapy, after the program, Donna began asking me questions about Emily's care. Her tone was accusatory. Emily and I had moved in together only recently. I think the questions had to do with our bed. It didn't have a boxspring for a while. I asked Donna why she was asking me these questions. She said since I'm the care-giver, I was in charge.</p>
<p>I said, &quot;Emily is right here. Why not ask her?&quot; This made Donna angry. She insisted again I'm the care-giver, I have to be in charge. As she walked away, never getting answers to her questions, I said louder, &quot;Emily is standing right here! You can ask her directly! You should ask her questions about her choices and situation.&quot;</p>
<p>Darin herded his two wives out the door and gave me the evil eye.</p>
<p>2) At Madigan hospital Emily and I were trying to get a urine sample in the restroom. Donna came in. This was the day Emily was given two months to live. Her cellular phone rang and I answered. The caller asked where Emily would be receiving hospice care. I specified our address near Wright Park. Donna became accusatory. &quot;Is that what Emily wants?&quot; Emily confirmed many, many times it is what she wanted, but Donna operates on a wishful notion of other people: When they agree, they're good. When they disagree with her plan, there is something wrong going on. I asked sarcastically, but sincerely,</p>
<p>&quot;Donna, do you think Emily wants to live with her parents?&quot; Then I asked Emily if she wants to stay at home for hospice, and she said she did.</p>
<p>In the meeting with the doctor, when Emily was given two months to live, Darin invited me to move into his home along with Emily and Chloe.</p>
</div>
<div id="2014post">
<h2 id="alienation-effort-against-my-family">Alienation effort against my family</h2>
<p>On June 20<sup>th</sup>, Chloe said, “&quot;Grandma says I can't see you and I can't see anyone in your family, not even Epona!&quot; Donna Mairs also prohibited Howard Dempsey from attending the visit on that day at his own home. On October 1<sup>st</sup>, Chloe explained that Donna prohibits all adult members of my family from attending visits, unless the visit occurs on their own property. Chloe stated that she wished they could attend. I agreed to keep asking Donna to approve any adult member of my family. On about five occasions since, I invited Donna to choose an adult member of my family to attend a visit, or invite Chloe to choose. Donna first chose Epona, a 13 year old. When I explained that Epona was not an adult, Donna prohibited any other family members from attending. Once I failed to explicitly prohibit Epona from being chosen, so Donna chose her again. On November 8<sup>th</sup> Chloe explained that Donna’s strictness is rooted in not wanting Chloe exposed to any “bad influences.” I continue requesting the GAL to overrule this hostile effort to destroy relationships Chloe developed with Emily’s full support over 5 years, which I can substantiate with strong photographic evidence. I also strongly object to the characterization of my family as full of “bad influences,” <strong>especially in conversations with Chloe Murphy</strong>.</p>
<p>My biological family regularly took Chloe to the park, zoo, and mountain, or just played with Chloe while I cared for Emily. I have no reason to believe they are a bad influence on anyone, and Chloe misses them.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="im-not-so-impressed-by-their-household">I’m not so impressed by their household</h2>
<p>Outside Donna's home, a pathway lined by dangerous refuse and rusted metal is used daily to pass to and from the back door to the front of the house. Significant falling danger places children and adults at risk daily. This dangerous condition has persisted since at least 2010.</p>
<p>Richard plays video games and watches home improvement t.v. all day. I have only rarely seen him leave his recliner. Richard has many tools and is handy in his work at U.P.S., but his house includes only half of a major remodel but I have not seen progress on it since activity ceased prior to 2010.</p>
<p>Neither Donna nor Richard have energy Chloe needs. I have a large body of photos showing Chloe engaging with me in outdoor activities, including swimming, boating, hitting a birthday pinata. I have not seen Donna or Richard engage in these activities with Chloe, either directly or through photographs. In birthday photos, Donna Mairs sits on the grass whole Chloe and I play with the pinata.</p>
<p>Donna is diabetic, and requires constant insulin through a machine. She is often lethargic, and seems disconnected from conversation. She also seems emotionally disassociated.</p>
<div id="rapist">
<h2 id="convicted-violent-child-rapist-3-counts">Convicted Violent Child Rapist, 3 Counts</h2>
<p>Sarah exposed her daughter Ally to a sex offender who targets children. This man sexually assaulted Ally. Later, in Donna's home, Ally sexually assaulted Chloe at least twice, in the bath and the attic, according to Emily. I am not aware of any action taken by Donna Mairs to prevent the sexual attacks in her home.</p>
<p>Jenny dated a felon imprisoned for nonconsensual, “violent” sex abuse of a minor or minors. Donna welcomed this man into her home even when Jenny was not present, as a dinner guest. This caused me substantial distress with Chloe in the home.</p>
</div>
<div id="13fall">
<p>Around 2010, Donna and Richard Mairs financed a major home remodel using credit cards. The remodel was not completed. Substantial debt remained into 2011 and likely remains today. In a meeting in Fall 2013, Darin expressed concerns that benefits earned by Emily's Marine service intended for Chloe would instead finance Mairs home debt. The Mairs home is large. It has housed 6 people. It now houses 3.</p>
</div>
<div id="scare">
<h2 id="abusive-by-nature">Abusive by nature</h2>
<p>I witnessed Donna shame Chloe in May, 2014 over a minor detail discrepancy that Chloe could not have known: I said I would call her teacher but met with her instead. Donna interrogated Chloe about this discrepancy, even though Chloe had no way to know I had changed the contact approach. Chloe was visibly frightened by this interrogation. I believe she was expected to feel ashamed for an error she had no awareness of. I believe this shame is part of a pattern Donna uses to control juveniles. I believe this tactic has caused substantial harm to juveniles she has raised.</p>
<p>Donna shows hostility toward me in front of Chloe in ways Chloe finds very distressing. My attempts to reach out to Donna have been unsuccessful. Chloe describes &quot;being in the middle&quot; as a terrible feeling. I do not criticize Donna or any other family members in front of Chloe.</p>
</div>
<h1 id="welcome-to-darin">Welcome to Darin</h1>
<p>He stands on no principles but greed and a craving to control and own money and people. A sociopath is changed by severe childhood abuse to simulate feelings in order to get what he wants from people. Emily characterized Darin as &quot;really screwed up&quot;. Here's a video of Mr. Murphy being tasered:</p>
<p>A sociopath often has unusual relationships with pain.</p>
<h1 id="darin-loves-emily-and-thats-the-problem">Darin loves Emily and that’s the problem</h1>
<p>Notice Darin came to Donna's with a card about Emily the Marine service. Darin is at the mercy of his feelings toward Emily. That's probably 90% of what's driving Darin. Chloe was a dollar figure, and a prize, and by defeating me, he avenges what he saw as my sleight of Emily, even though he does so at the cost of Emily herself.</p>
<p>He had her love and trust because he helped her medically, but then he opposed her wishes for Chloe, and the trust she had given him was rapidly destroyed. He did this. I imagine it hurt, to be so stupid. But he loved Emily, in an incredibly fucked up notion of love. Like all who loved her, he loved her passionately. She evoked passion in people. It just happens that his love is sadistically demented and bleak.</p>
<p>Can't he disagree with Emily, yet respect her wishes anyway? Isn't that how love works? To carry the torch for Emily, he defies her, degrades her, &quot;disagrees&quot; until she's sick of him. Until the plan is his plan, it is never really “settled”. He badgered her as she died. He is at the mercy of his twisted inner psychology, ripped in circles by his strong feelings for Emily, plus a general need to control everyone about everything important. As a god. An angry god.</p>

<h1 id="darin-over-the-years">Darin over the years</h1>
<p>I was a teenager when we both ran our respective bulletin board systems on computers in the mid-80’s.</p>
<h2 id="the-info-board-social-nexus">The INFO Board, social nexus</h2>
<p>Around 1986 I attended one or two INFO Board get-togethers at Godfather’s pizza on 6<sup>th</sup> Avenue. A young Darin threw a gathering for INFO Board users. Some of his daughters might have been there. I don’t even think Jenny was born yet, though maybe. Darin gave some novelty gifts and we all ate pizza. My dad was there. I was probably 17. Darin inspired me to start my own BBS.</p>
<p>The INFO Board was a Tacoma-based computer-to-computer message sharing board, called a “BBS”. About 10-20 people visited it habitually from home computers in and around Tacoma. This is how I met Darin, and also Harry. Darin’s daughters know Harry as “Powdered Toast Man” because once he wore that costume to a party Darin hosted.</p>
<p>I became Darin’s right-hand man for day-to-day operations and projects on the INFO Board. In corporate terms, another man, Chip Taylor, was essentially Vice President, and I was operations. This computer system was a social nexus and its largest crowd was mine, including Harry, Dena (who I met there and dated), Dani, Jack, Mark, and some other guys from my high school. Darin had the unique perspective of being able to watch people writing to one another on this computer, but largely he was hand’s off and occupied with making money.</p>
<p>I think he did try to get a sexy young woman to be his assistant, someone he met through the INFO Board, but Donna objected.</p>
<p>When I was in college, I’d upload some essays to the INFO Board and Darin would read some.</p>
<p>The people on INFO Board and systems like it occasionally met up and partied. Darin hosted quite a few parties for people of the INFO Board. When I was 17 or so, Darin was one of a small number of System Operators. I organized parties among my friends at Darin's house. I woke up on his livingroom floor at 22 with a new girlfriend, who I met on the INFO Board, when Jenny, 4, insisted I was her pillow, and asked if I want French toast and strawberry syrup.</p>
<p>I typed sexytalk with Donna on the INFO Board in a private communication around 1993.</p>

<p>Emily’s sister Melissa had a bit of a crush on me when she was a young teen. She’d just sit next to me and smile at me. I was a welcome guest in the home. It’d be kind of late, just Melissa and me, until she’d go to bed and I’d drive away.</p>
<h2 id="we-also-played-a-game-i-learned-in-junior-high">We also played a game I learned in junior high</h2>
<p>When I was a teenager, around 1987, I wrote software that Darin and other friends would dial in to and play a space strategy game called Galaxy. Darin won at least one epic game, taking place over 50 days. He implemented Excel spreadsheets to calculate battle odds.</p>
<p>We played again in 2002 when I rebuilt the game using the web browser.</p>
<h2 id="guns-in-the-sticks-real-and-video-game">Guns in the sticks, real and video game</h2>
<p>In rural Pierce County, near Mountain Highway, Darin co-owned a rural spot where he shot guns with friends, including Mike Bitow, blowing oil barrels above the treetops with explosives. Once we had a party there. The sheriff shut down the guns by relaying a report from nearby neighbors frightened by the sounds. At dark Darin set up his laptop on a tree stump. The game was Castle Wolfenstein, the first &quot;First Person Shooter&quot; video game. I was impressed. We all sat at a campfire. Often Darin's kids were present, as were kids from the INFO Board and related communities. The year was around 1993, perhaps earlier.</p>
<h2 id="i-worked-for-darin-around-1993">I worked for Darin around 1993</h2>
<p>I graduate from college and move to Tacoma, just 4 blocks from Darin’s home. He hires me as his driver and assistant.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Lots of driving and chatting.</p></li>
<li><p>We visit Dina’s home. She became his 2<sup>nd</sup> wife later. Dina is married to a guy who would get into crack cocaine and leave her.</p></li>
<li><p>Lots of quick meals on the run, trips to Olympia, Bremerton, and all around Tacoma.</p></li>
<li><p>Darin was always wheeling and dealing. He’d have the latest cellular phone (quite rare in those days), he’d get some ammunition in bulk (or try to), he’d get cellphones with one plan and change it to another. In those days it was easy to set customers and one’s self up with illegally copied software. Darin would claim licensure of software by specifying the owner is: “You and I and all Mankind.”</p></li>
<li><p>Once Darin sold a glare guard as an anti-radiation shield. I installed it at the client’s office, an Olympia seller of hippy ointments and sundries.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Darin and I were an onsite consultant duo who spent considerable hours together over many years.</p>
<p>Mostly I picked up little jobs and hung out with him. What does a narcissist want more than a fan? And I was a fan.</p>
<p>When I worked for Darin, he got me a cellular phone when they were rare. He loaned me a low-end laptop that I used to write.</p>
<p>In my employment for Darin I was paid something like $10/hr to drive him from his fire station shift (48 hours) to Bremerton Shipyard. I would buy food he'd eat before sleeping as I drove. He got me two other jobs with other people, but I lost both.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I accompanied him to a client's home to explain they had fatal dataloss.</p></li>
<li><p>I installed stuff for customers of his in Olympia.</p></li>
<li><p>I took his car to the mechanic to replace the brakes.</p></li>
<li><p>He showed me a remote control car racetrack and we watched a while.</p></li>
<li><p>He gave a secretary my number, which was awkward. He said, &quot;Fat girls need love, too.&quot; His other advice: &quot;Flirt with all the women, <em>especially</em> the fat ones.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>One job he got me was through Egghead, but I didn’t really fit in.</p></li>
<li><p>Another job he got me was for a guy everyone called Stubbs cuz he’s short. He sold computers. But he went under a few weeks water. No job.</p></li>
<li><p>During the 1990's, routinely provided unlawfully duplicated software to me, including Magellan (a file search tool), and hard drive tools including SpinRite.</p></li>
<li><p>As employee, I drove his car to hardware retailers and then installed hardware such as anti-glare screen or printer at customer side unattended.</p></li>
<li><p>Would handle his personal and business calls from the car while he taught at Bremerton Naval Ship Yard.</p></li>
<li><p>He loaned me a cellular telephone and a laptop computer, for “business use”.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="section-3">2002</h2>
<p>I was in a pinch selling a house. I needed to top a tree that blocked the knockout view. Darin drove to Seattle and topped two trees for me. Wasn’t that kind?</p>
<p>In Bauhaus, a coffee cafe' in Seattle, explained to me that his 3rd daughter had begun using methamphetimine through her associaties at the sandwich shop where she worked.</p>
<p>I authored some technical information as an exercise. Darin regularly visited my publication through the internet to view my activities.</p>
<h2 id="section-4">2003</h2>
<p>Darin had provided me with a password to his home computer. At one point he let me watch his motion-sensing camera as he and Dina came and went. I had the password to his VNC server. When I encountered digital photographs of the capture of Saddam Hussein, I used VNC to log in to his computer and place these photographs on his desktop computer.</p>
<p>Harry and I stopped at Darin's house in Spanaway to ask him to examine the cargo security on my car as we left for Nevada. He was happy to give us some help.</p>
<h2 id="section-5">2005</h2>
<p>Darin was proud of Emily’s success in the Marine Corps. He gave me her email address. I wrote a short letter wishing her luck. Emily served for 8 years, and developed brain cancer. Darin was very active organizing necessary medical travel for two operations, over many years. He always had test results and xrays he was studying.</p>
<p>One day he visited me in Downtown Seattle. He showed me the entrance to the employee-only dining area for Nordstrom. We bought lunches there and chatted.</p>
<p>around the same time, he gave me an address and password to his computer on the internet.</p>
<p>i used this information to log in and put pictures of the capture of s.h. on his desktop.</p>
<h2 id="section-6">2006?</h2>
<p>Darin married Dina in downtown Tacoma. Of course I was there. I took some photos of his daughters there. Darin put my bicycle in the trunk of his rented fancy car, or maybe it was his purple car, and he drove me with his new wife to the place where I lived. Isn’t that sweet?</p>
<p>I think after helping me with the tree (around 2002) he visited with Dina around 2006, my little treehouse home.</p>

<p>Gangsta. I paid a lot for tickets to a kinda lame party for Emily’s birthday. Did Jenny take this pic? And Greg liked it. Sounds like family to me.</p>
<h2 id="ish-2">2012-ish</h2>
<p>Darin picked me up from the Puyallup train station and drove me to Jenny’s wedding. Juan Pablo was with us. I sat with Kris in the back and coached him on being a ring bearer. I think Richard was mean to Kris on that day.</p>
<p>In early 2013, Mr. Murphy expressed to Emily that it's problematic that I'm &quot;half-family&quot;. Does he deny saying this now? Emily's response was to invite me to the BRIDGES counseling, where Mr. Murphy introduced me as Emily's partner. And then I became the pillar that made sure E &amp; C attended BRIDGES. Anyway, what's &quot;half-family&quot; and why is it his problem? And that sounds pretty close to family, doesn't it? &quot;Half-family?&quot;</p>

<p>Darin saw this photo along with hundreds of others that spanned Emily’s life, as we waited for Emily to finish an MRI. Darin said this was a cute photo. I gave Darin a full backup of photos of Emily and Chloe that I had. My shirt says DEMPSEY UNIVERSITY. I do NOT see the resemblance between Chloe and the child in the video.</p>
<p>I think in 2013 on Halloween I was at Darin’s house with Emily and Chloe, and we trick-treated the area. Usually we went to Uncle Ned’s in Seattle, but that time we were at Darin’s.</p>
<h2 id="ish-4">2014-ish</h2>
<p>At my first Bridges therapy, it was Darin, Donna, and me, in the “care-givers” group. Darin introduced me as Emily’s partner.</p>
<p>During later 2014 grief therapy, asserted that i had betrayed him somehow. his wife also made this claim. after therapy i asked his wife why. she said because chloe should be with her or donna. i asked if emily also betrayed her. she said no, that emily's decision about chloe was uninformed, or based on stupidity or not caring for chloe. darin listened, said nothing.</p>
<p>He requested to be my Gmail chat buddy. Imagine that.</p>
<p>We all went to San Francisco with Emily and Melissa:</p>

<p>This photo was Emily’s telephone background. If only it was her reality. Two people helping. Nope, couldn’t have that. And she called the sensation, “tearing”. She said that’s how it felt when Darin divorced Donna, and Darin had only redeemed himself by helping Emily with her medical needs. He threw that trust away.</p>

<h2 id="mexico-travel-1-april-may-2009">Mexico Travel 1: April &amp; May, 2009</h2>
<div id='pre-em-mexico'>

<ul>
<li><p>Invitation: I hadn’t been in close contact with Darin in 2009, but I must have written about something, and he invited me to Melissa’s wedding. At that wedding I saw Emily, and saw Emily’s tattoo (which said CHLOE), but did not meet Chloe. (She was napping.) Darin invited me to come to Puerto Vallarta and stay with him.</p></li>
<li><p>Darin insists on two things in Mexico: He doesn’t wear a watch, and he doesn’t wear underwear.</p></li>
<li><p>Darin discussed the availability of hit men in Mexico, where he owned a time-share condo in the more-American part of town, north of Puerto Vallarta. (Nuevo Vallarta.) He called his condo and someone answered, which was unexpected. Darin believed his wife to be ruthless and greedy, and he believed his status as her spouse might incentivize her to have him killed so she would receive both assets and fire department pension. Some member or members of Mariela’s family reportedly asked if he needed to have someone “taken care of” and he declined this offer. Darin explained that Mexico is a place where people just “disappear”. He said Dina had stolen at least $100,000.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>April 10:</strong> Darin found a bicycle I could ride, but the tube exploded. Darin took me, Melissa, and Rob to the beach in Puerto Vallarta. People stopped at various shops.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>April 13:</strong> Darin thanked Mario for allowing Darin to date Mariela, and stay in the house. Darin snuck Emily, Chloe, and me into a tourist resort water park, because Darin knows the guy at the counter. Later Darin jumped into my bed to cut off my wristband, so someone else could wear it to get into the water park. Darin and Jenny were in a very minor car accident.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>April 14:</strong> Darin drives Emily, Chloe, Jenny, and me with Mexican family to a small, local resort: A grill, a pool, a zipline overhead (we didn’t go on it). I swam with Chloe in the pool. Everyone asked how old she was (in Spanish).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>April 20:</strong> I start falling for Emily. She has terrible allergies.</p></li>
<li><p>Trip Details: During that trip, I stayed in Darin’s duplex home, along with Melissa and Rob (on their honeymoon). Then Emily and Chloe arrived, and Melissa and Rob went somewhere else. Then Jenny arrived, and Darin’s dad Terry came with Terry’s wife. I told Emily I had a cozier bed than the one she was in, but she only checked it out on the second night. Darin got us some marijuana and we had a wildly memorable time, walking to the taco shop for fresh squeezed juice.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>May 2<sup>nd</sup></strong>: Darin drove Emily, Chloe, me, and Mexican family to a family baptism, three hours. One boy had a birthday, too, and sang 3 traditional Mexican songs karaoke style. Then a woman entertainer sang ten songs.</p></li>
<li><p>I spent evenings cobbling my experiences into narratives with photos, including photos taken on Darin’s camera and my own. These photo essays are still available.</p></li>

<h3 id="movie-star">Movie Star</h3>
<p>Darin projected <em>Night of the Iguana</em> on the wall at Mariela’s house. Her father Mario is a carpenter. He built the whole 3 story cement home, with business, workshop, and cool penthouse. It turns out Mario is in this movie from 1963, when Puerto Vallarta was a fishing and farming town. He was an iguana pitch kid then, holding the iguana above his head so people would stop and pay to see the iguana. We watched his brief cameo many times. He said the movie made the city famous, and then in 1969 the international airport made it into a tourist destination.</p>
<h3 id="drug-dealer-neighbor">Drug Dealer Neighbor</h3>
<p>Mariela got some joints from her neighbor friend. Later he would be murdered in prison, and his family suspected Mario’s family, until someone became a godfather, and Darin set up running water for the family who lost their son.</p>

<p>This was a few days before Emily arrived. The backstreets of the city are dusty, and we had to cover up. While gunning through the dusty roads, I saw chickens, horses, dogs, cinderblock shacks, and of course Mexicans! Some of them pushed ice cream carts. My 4-wheeler did not have functioning brakes. Fun! At the top of the hillside we all stopped for snacks and looked out over the city.</p>
