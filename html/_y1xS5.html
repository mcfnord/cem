<p>the child rapist is on my living room floor. he gave me the creeps from the first moment. he's got a new computer, his first laptop. he's never here, he's always there. disappeared. he's all twisted with regard to protocol, proper levels of control. his girlfriend danced in my kitchen and it flipped him out a little. meanwhile i busted moves with all three the girls. he's a bit afraid of the wild beyond. perhaps it is where he wants to rape children. and perhaps he knows he can't go there. wish as he may. perhaps on a computer, perhaps in a foreign country. everyone's been universally grim about the upside, and they're right. he won't be in my apartment. he'll be down the street somewhere. he better be present and accounted for. he better not have ideas about anything &quot;easier&quot; in mexico.</p>
<p>Invitation: As you might gather from his web site, Darin was trying to start an “organic, in-town, real Mexico” tourist service. Mariela had a friend who worked at the airport, in a Mexican apartment. Their idea was that the woman and her son would stay elsewhere while we rented their home. This didn’t really work: The apartment was very hot and very small. So after calling 6 other leads, they found an exceptional condo for us, with a pool. T.V., breezy, nice place. And this Frida Kalo knock-off, starring Emily. This is where I taught Chloe to swim. Darin stayed near Mariela’s family, with Candace and Candace’s (step?-)sister. We called that place The Hacienda.</p>

<p>Chloe’s 3<sup>rd</sup> birthday. I’m pretty sure I paid for at least half of that bouncy castle, and at least half of that piñata!</p>
<p>I had an idea to rent a boat and go visit some rocks. We didn’t get to sail but it was fun.</p>

<p>Emily, with child sex attacker Brian Herrington’s bald head. Jenny, and Candace Zygar’s half-sister.</p>
<p>Darin made Hugo, his fireman friend, a really strong lemondrop, and Hugo got sick. Later that week, Hugo drove Emily, Chloe, and me to Las Palmas and we rappelled off an old bridge there. Below was a river with water like a bath, and we had a swimming picnic.</p>

<p>Solidad, Mariela’s mom, brought us a cooked chicken. Las Palmas is a clean, pretty town with boys on horses and the largest hat we've seen so far. We had popsickles there. Mine was lime.</p>

<p>Hugo the fireman drove us to Las Palmas and we rappelled off an old bridge there. Below was a river with water like a bath, and we had a swimming picnic. Solidad, pictured here, brought us a cooked chicken. (You might remember her wedding, last year.) Las Palmas is a clean, pretty town with boys on horses and the largest hat we've seen so far. We had popsickles there. Mine was lime.</p>

<p><strong>Why does Mexico dig 1985?</strong></p>
<p>In Mexico, I attended a day-long family fiesta. 100 people stood under shades eating tacos, kids in a play set or trampoline netting in 11 at a time. By the afternoon they'd developed a synch of bounces and games in the trampoline. A man dressed like a snappy Mexican cowboy told some jokes, came and sat on my lap, like we'd kiss. He led me sing some lyrics to a traditional Mexican song. He poured booze into the birthday man's mouth for 5 seconds, each decade of his 50 years. Then the American pop songs came, all from 1985.</p>
<p>My theory why this is: Cassettes from 1985 are now reaching Mexican countryside tape collections. Today I sang I Will Survive which is currently a big hit here. I heard Rick Astley, but not (Never Gonna) Give You Up, no, Together Forever. Of 10 American songs played, 2 were from 2010, and 8 were from 1985, including Depeche Mode.</p>
<p>One woman turned her hundred drained chicken eggs into crepe paper, confetti and powder smash-bombs. The children grabbed them and mashed them into each other's hair, then fetched half-broken ones in second and third rounds. Everyone's hair showed white talcum, spangles, glitter, and paper streamers. I put Chloe in a fountain pool. We took a taxi home, and I tried to ask: Why is Puerto Vallarta two half moons with a huge empty field in the middle? Something about money, he said. I didn't tip just cuz I wanted to hold a twenty peso note. I don't know why that happened. It wasn't that nice.</p>
<p>Chloe called it the <em>trampolina</em>, wanting to go in so badly. Some guy asked her something in Spanish, and she just said &quot;Yes&quot; cheerful and dismissive, &quot;Yes, and it doesn't even really matter.&quot; like a socialite. I taught her that word yes last year! Previously she relied on No to represent both meanings, yes and no.</p>
<p>Emily thanked me for being a daddy. I am not a father. I'm a dad.</p>

<p>Chloe was crying at the door, stepped to me and fell forward, fell to the floor together, fell asleep on my arm. We all laid on the floor, in front of the fan. We ate bbq turkey burgers. She said she missed me. She said would I help her go pee, and I said she's 3, she can do it, so in defiance, for the first time, she dropped her pants and peed on my deck. Then we played with a bucket of ice. She was afraid of the new hammock. Some girls get stuff by crying, but some girls get stuff by trying, so I taunted her from the cozy hammock, until she tried grabbing the frame and climbing up. So it turns out this half-moon &quot;teardrop&quot; hammock shape is ideal for her to climb all over my head and shoulders, more like a spider than a monkey. I made her wait until it was dark to watch Kipper meet a ghost. Then she said I'm beautiful, 4 times. At bedtime, she wanted what seemed to be open-mouth kisses. Um. NO YER BEAUTIFUL LITTLE ONE.</p>
