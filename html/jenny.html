<h1 id="jennifer-murphy-sex-scandal">Jennifer Murphy Sex Scandal</h1>
<p>It took me some time to remember what went on in the 1990's in the family.</p>
<p>The reason I was talking sexually with Jennifer is because the girls always spoke very sexually explicitly with me. That was strange, especially for such an obviously very strict family. They complied with serious strictures, but spoke like sailors, except for Donna. Actually, they wouldn't swear, almost never, but they would talk about sex explicitly. Jenny was as vocal as the rest, and as curious as the rest, which has always been fun (until today!) because Jenny is very conservative and chaste and really always was, the most religious sister by far. She sometimes drank and got high as an adult, but was also drawn to strict moderation. But yep, she always spoke in sexually explicit terms with me and her sisters.</p>
<p>Emily said more than once that the high libido was the &quot;defining&quot; characteristic of a Murphy, the essence of one.</p>
<p>I don't know if you have understood, or need to understand, the whole psychology of Darin Murphy, but Emily said she thought Darin's intense sexuality was an ingredient in this characteristic of the girls. As adults and very young adults, and with Emily over many years, the sisters often spoke of their sexual interest level as very high, and described this as a characteristic of them as a generation in the family. They would say &quot;Murphy girls are horny!&quot; I don't know if you grew up this way, and I did not. I was sexually charged as young people typically are, but I never thought, &quot;Dempsey kids are horny!&quot;</p>
<p>So a decade passes of this, and wham, it leads to frank conversation in a wholly chaste long-term friendship. I danced with Jenny as a child, because I dance. We've danced many times together since. Recently we danced explicitly as adults at a disco, and snuggled platonically together to keep warm in a cold apartment in 2012. Of course I danced at her wedding, too. I know Jenny! As a child and an adult.</p>
<p>The whole family talked sexually. All four girls and basically Darin. I had forgotten about this detail, because it isn't this way anymore. Emily once told me she figured the girls were all this way because Darin had a very high level of sexual energy. Whatever the cause, Murphy girls loved talking about sex with John Dempsey and each other. And TALKING has never felt wrong to me. Never did anyone touch, ever, but I had very sexually specific (not vulgar) verbal relationships with Jennifer, Sarah, Melissa, and (later) Emily, which they initiated and I treated with high respect. That was a long time ago, and I had forgotten about it.</p>
<p>So now I'm off dancing and talking sex with a girl who tries to kiss me!? It was the only time she ever tried. Jenny (famously) said at age five, &quot;Mom, how old will John be when I'm old enough to get married?&quot; Melissa also had a huge crush on me for about a year. I'd be around after dinner one evening, and everyone's gone to bed, but she's beside me, not speaking or touching, just looking at me, very happy. She would clearly appear overpowered by the crush, just gazing on me, kind of paralyzed. I would smile and sit, eventually hug her and go home. I had nothing but high regard and deep affection for these girls. I was in their lives for two decades. Throughout that time, I behaved like the adult I am.</p>
<p>Further, it has never felt like a challenge to demonstrate respect for sexual boundaries with my hands and actions. This was not gray or blurry to me. It would surprise me if any Murphy girl would say I disrespected them at any moment in my life, or sexualized them at any moment of their childhoods. In fact it's my feeling that their socialization as sexual objects for religious causes is a grave harm to them. I was very conscious of their strict religious environment. And I had both then and now a strict moral code against any adult sexualizing a child. We all apparently believed words didn't count. Not explicitly sexualizing them--society does that constantly with girls, and I've known that for a long time--but talking explicitly about sex, including experiences. Murphy girls wanted this kind of conversation all day long.</p>
<p>There's truth, and there's the whole truth. And this story of me and the Murphys most certainly is...</p>

<h2 id="stalker">Stalker</h2>
<p>Darin emailed me late October, 2004 with many pages of unrequited love letters from Tim, in his 30’s, who sought Jenny’s hand in marriage when she was 16. In this same period I stayed on the bus an extra stop to visit her at home. We both went downtown, her for High School, and me for a job I had there. She and I were there alone at her home together. She mentioned this guy Tim. I asked if she liked him and she said not really. So I said just forget about him, let’s go to the museum together. That’s the flow how it came together. So Darin certainly trusted me enough to give me his teenage daughter’s stalker’s intel file, or that other time he told me Melissa was on crack.</p>
