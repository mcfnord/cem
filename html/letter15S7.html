<p>On this page with cancer I've placed this rare photo of Kyle with you.</p>

<p>Emily said Kyle's a coward, and I agree. Maybe your head will be shaped like his.</p>

<p>Oh look, once he showed you the fishies, and that's cool.</p>
<p>Kyle approved of the adoption before Donna's attorney told him sick lies about me. Kyle just wants to avoid trouble. I personally think if he wanted to run away from you, he should have had the decency to respect Emily's wishes and plans for you. But that's giving him far too much credit. He was not respectful to Emily. To this day, he disrespects her wishes for you. So... I think Kyle's a punk. But he's your biological dad. Whether you want to speak to him, or not speak to him, that's really your choice. I don't think there's magic to a parent who runs away, or magic to the meaning of your life in his. Kyle skipped town and that made Em mad. He didn't even send a postcard! What a punk. Whereas me, I'm your dad, for life, as promised.</p>
