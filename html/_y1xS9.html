<p>I speculate a guess that I took Chloe from Donna’s church after a Christmas celebration where Donna played bells. I took Chloe to Seattle after that event.</p>

<p>When Emily turned 30, we all ate at Johnny Bahama’s in Southgate Mall. I ate a little and Chloe and I ran around the empty parking lot.</p>
<p>Once Emily cooked salmon at Donna’s and Darin and I ate it.</p>
<p>Darin ate sushi on 6<sup>th</sup> ave with Emily and me pretty recently, perhaps early 2013.</p>
<p>It was 2012 or 2013 when I bought Donna lunch on Broadway in Seattle. It was Thai food. Emily was with us. Donna sold me a fundraiser chocolate bar for Stanley Elementary.</p>

<p>I visited Chloe's kindergarten and met her teacher. She visited and made friends with other kids in the apartment.</p>

<p>Emily had a seizure while driving and crashed the car with her and Chloe inside. They are both uninjured, but Emily might have a tumor in her head again. A doctor looked and said yeah, that's a tumor, but really we won't know until they compare this scan with the previous scans. I went to Chloe's concert and she sang well but she's freaking out, from car crashes, from nightmares, from Mom in the hospital promising she won't die today. And she won't die today. But I went back to drop off her phone and the room was empty. They just moved her to another room. Ugh, scary moment. So Emily is in the hospital again tonight. Chloe is spending the night with me. She just fell asleep. I knew this might happen one day. Cuz that's how cancer works. I am the only other person in the world who cares for Chloe close to the way Emily does. Well, it's early, don't overthink it.﻿</p>
