<p>Dear Ms. Irvin,</p>
<p>I have no concerns with the fact that John Dempsey is adopting Chloe. I know the adoption is in the best interests of Chloe. I watched as Chloe, years ago, began calling John, “Dad.” John patiently explained that he wasn’t Chloe’s “Dad” and she persisted. Chloe knew, and it took the rest of us some time to catch up, that John is Chloe’s Dad.</p>
<p>Chloe has been a member of this family for years. John has loved Chloe as his daughter for years even though he did not want her to be confused by the fact, which he explained patiently, that there were complications in that definition of the relationship. At family events, from Thanksgiving through Christmas and to camping in the family compound in Ocean Park every year for several years John has been Chloe’s Dad and Emily has been Chloe’s Mom. They look just like any other family. Chloe goes to sleep in Dad’s lap and John tends to family matters like cleanup and trips to the beach.</p>
<p>I have a few hundred pictures in the family album for anyone who wishes further empirical and admissible evidence. I took the pictures over the years at real family events and the chain of custody is impeccable. Chloe at the beach, Chloe dressed as a princess at Christmas and Chloe wolfing down a turkey at Thanksgiving are all still just Chloe being a kid in a family.</p>
<p>I have included a sheet of random shots that will give anyone who is asking a graphic impression of the facts. Please feel free to call me is I can offer any additional support to this most important event in both of their lives.</p>
<p>Yours truly,</p>
<p>Herb Dempsey</p>
