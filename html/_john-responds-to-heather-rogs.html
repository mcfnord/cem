<p>Any relationship with Chloe Murphy should be either at her initiation or carefully screened by invested parties, unless and until Mr. Coker shows a pattern of commitment, which contrasts with the harmful pattern or broken promises he has shown in her life so far.</p>

<p>Facts rebutting</p>
<p>Kyle took the time to write a lengthy pleading in this case. Why? In theory, maybe he thought he’d really, truly start a relationship with Chloe this time.</p>
<p>Facts supporting</p>
<p>Kyle failed to follow through on claims of love and commitment made in his pleading. He has suggested similar claims of intent to parent previously, and none of those went anywhere, either.</p>
<p>Emily called Kyle a coward. There is no room for cowards here. His words paint all sorts of pictures, but his deeds show just one. He gives every indication of a desire to be free of this legal status, except when he’s calling Chloe and messing with her head about finally meeting her. It must stop.</p>

<p>For 5 years, Emily Murphy sought my active role as Chloe’s dad.</p>
<p>Emily’s disability also necessitated my intentional focus on both logistics and day-to-day operations. I planned travel and day trips based on mobility and (later) stamina limits. During 2013, her stamina diminished, and she began sleeping and needing sleep or naps more frequently. During 2014, dizziness emerged until hospice medications began.</p>
<p>When Chloe occupied my house, whether Emily was present or not, I prepared well in advance, steam-cleaning all carpets, gathering healthy and delicious food, and having clean linens ready.</p>
<p>My parenting began before the word ‘dad’ was used. While together in Seattle, Emily supported our family designation from an early point, where I am Chloe's dad. Specifically, when Emily and I were separating, Emily told Chloe that I am Chloe's dad. I also said this to Chloe. For the prior year, when Chloe was 2, I preferred to just be John. However, my behavior as a primary parent began as soon as Chloe came into my life.</p>
<p>While together in Seattle, we relied on my apartment, resources and planning, as well as my physical ability.</p>
<p>While together in Tacoma, Emily had less strength, balance, and stamina, and we relied on my resources and planning, and my ability to drive (which she lacked).</p>
<p>While dining out or paying a bill, especially a bill involving Chloe, Emily and I paid in rough parity.</p>
<p>When paying a car rental bill, I paid, and there were many.</p>
<p>When travelling with Emily, I'd always pump the gas, so I'd always pay for the gas, too.</p>
<p>In 2014, in our household finances, Emily and I paid equally in finer parity.</p>
<p>During these periods of time, Chloe relied on my provision of food, sanitation, safety, financial and emotional support (which Chloe, Emily, and I referred to as &quot;love&quot;).</p>
<p>This qualifies me as a de facto parent. The designation &quot;primary&quot; parent is misleading and not relevant to the question before the court.</p>
<p>During Chloe’s 2<sup>nd</sup> year, us three spent most weekends and all major holidays together. We travelled together for x weeks.</p>
<p>Review evidence and infer time commitment in both interaction and preparation necessary. Review videos, photos, and other records. Also paste from GAL records, maybe.</p>

<p>28. In practice, I am able to engage with Child actively in parks, on bikes, etc.</p>
<p>For example, in 2013, my sister Jan and her husband Tom took Chloe, Ally, and me to Zoo Lights while Donna and Richard Mairs stayed home. I have invited Donna Mairs to join me during many visits, and she has declined. Perhaps she is repulsed by me, or perhaps in practice her energy level renders her opinion about physical activities moot.</p>

<p>Chloe has benefitted from counseling designed for creative children, because she is an unusually creative child. The Mairs have removed her from counseling programs long-established by Emily and me for Chloe’s mental and emotional health at this time. I strongly differ with the Mairs on the prudence of these decisions.</p>
<p>Based on the declaration of Katy Johnson, where she made no effort to investigate an allegation of child pornography before reporting both a mandatory reporter claim and making a medical judgement, and based on Donna Mairs’ receipt of counseling from same, I doubt the impartiality and judgement of Katy Johnson to see serious indicators of emotional sickness in her client, Donna Mairs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Emily welcomed my involvement in Chloe’s life as soon as I met Chloe. Emily showed this by leaving Chloe in my care for short and longer periods, and ultimately by assuring Chloe was in my sole care even when Emily and I had a weak relationship. Her consent was implicit in her commitment to fostering the ongoing relationship through concrete efforts. When together, Emily, Chloe and I referred to ourselves as a “family,” engaged in “family hugs,” attended school functions together, travelled together, and lived together in weekend, international stay, and full-time time periods.</p>
<p>Emily consented to and fostered my relationship as future sole care-giver by instructing me on on how I was to raise Chloe. Emily’s strong teaching was:</p>
</blockquote>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Chloe must respect herself.</p></li>
<li><p>Parenting distills to: love, patience, and love.</p></li>
<li><p>No 16-year-old girl should attend Burning Man.</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Even where I might differ, I defer to Emily, knowing I owe my fatherhood to her.</p>
<p>During 2013, Emily refused my persuasion that Darin Murphy’s home represented Chloe’s best option, insisting consistently through 4 contacts with counsel in 2013 that she wished for me to be Chloe’s guardian. Even when Emily and I separated, Emily prioritized keeping me in Chloe’s life through day and overnight activities. Emily and I bathed with Chloe as a young child. Emily resisted a concerted, abusive effort by her mother, father, and various cohorts to dissuade her or stop her from consenting to and fostering my relationship with the child. That’s commitment to my relationship with the child, Chloe Murphy.</p>
<p>39. Kyle Coker initially had concluded, based on Emily’s information, that I am Chloe’s dad.</p>
<p>Mr. Coker told me and told Emily, “You are the dad,” referring to me. He signed away his parental rights to me. He verbally consented to 3<sup>rd</sup> party custodianship to Alece Cox. He initially strongly rejected Darin Murphy’s interference, and spoke poorly of him.</p>
<p>40. Emily and I split most travel expenses, including splitting costs for Chloe. When Emily and Chloe were with me in Seattle, my house was always clean, and my refrigerator was full of healthy, delicious food. When travelling with them in the United States by rental car, I paid this cost. When co-habitating, all costs were split 50-50, including expenses of Chloe, with these exceptions: Emily paid Chloe’s medical insurance, while I paid all costs associated with gaining custody of Chloe. When she was in my custody I took steps to add her to my insurance.</p>
<p>During the last 6 months of Emily’s life, I did not work outside the home. I worked inside the home during a crash course in advanced nursing. During this time, I also was closely involved in Chloe’s life, providing 6 months of skilled labor to them at no charge. Emily and Chloe had been close to me through many years of laboring, and I routinely spent money on their happiness prior to tri-habitation among us 3, and while I split expenses with Emily while tri-habitating, I provided 24-hour skilled labor to Emily and extensive parental support to Chloe.</p>
<p>For example, Emily and I purchased tickets to the dog show, where Donna and Chloe watched trick pups perform. I’ve arranged many trips to the zoo and paid the gate, or shared the cost with Emily. I paid for half of Chloe’s 5<sup>th</sup> birthday party. I don’t remember who paid for her 3<sup>rd</sup> in Mexico, but I probably participated financially. I bought her a scooter. I paid so she could go swimming all summer when she was 5. I gassed many cars over many years to move people around, including Chloe’s two older cousins. When dining at a restaurant or café’, which was a very common for us over very many years, we switched and shared financial responsibilities over time. While Emily paid a small part of the airfare for Chloe’s last trip to Mexico, I paid all lodging and dining expenses for myself and for Chloe. All camping expenses were my purchases, except Emily had her own sleeping bag and one for Chloe. Since Chloe was taken into custody by the state, I have visited her over many days observed by professionals, and over those many hours I provided completely for her through concrete financial support. I have done these things through her life when she’s with me.</p>
