<h3 id="raw-dog">Raw dog</h3>
<p>There was even an interesting time where I tried to accept Emily's choice of Donna over Darin. I couldn't do it. I had to do something to prevent Chloe from being raised by Donna. Obviously their skillfulness with fear-mongering and hysteria, and probably my laid-back nature didn't help. The city tried to chew me up. If a preponderance of evidence says I'm just too damn different, and Donna's actually Donna Reed, then fuck me with a 2x4. That's the whole dumb case in the whole dumb court. I'll stand for that verdict. Because it will also be made clear that Darin Murphy abused his daughter as she died.</p>
<p>I want to clarify I point that might seem confusing at first: From April to November, 2013, I tried to persuade Emily to specify Darin and Mariela as Chloe's guardians. I failed to persuade her. She knew her dad had serious emotional problems, and I just didn't see it from a distance. She said she had to go with her gut. She said Donna would do anything for Chloe. And she said, near November 12th, 2013, &quot;If you don't like it, change it. Come to Tacoma, and be the guardian.&quot; When I accepted that offer a week later, it was Emily who had persuaded me. I had failed to persuade her. I said I would try ONE TIME and I did try. I failed, and changed to a position of supporting whatever she wants, as long as she wants it, until the day she changes her mind. I hope you consider this position to be the precise formula of unconditional love. I am deeply offended by the various spins used to make it sinister, but I'm used to feeling deeply offended by this family of jackels.</p>
<p>I also want you to understand how this all looks to my family. My family has been very closely involved over the entire year. I called at least a few of them every day. Yours is the 5th investigation of me. Through the 4 previous investigations, no member of my family has ever been contacted. But the G.A.L. is supposed to be different. You are supposed to get to the bottom of things. For every minute I ever spent with Andrea Mattson, I spent hours with my mother or father, with Emily and Chloe with me. My whole family is educators. I hope you ask yourself if it makes sense I could conceal a harmful relationship in front of them over 5 years, when I couldn't apparently hide my allegedly wreched nature from Andrea for 5 minutes. My step-mother was Washington State's teacher of the year. My mother was Sumner School District's teacher of the year. Paula Brown is an educator, first aid instructor, and Washington State track and field official of the year. My father is a retired police officer and teacher's union president. Not much gets past these sorts of people. Andrea Mattson is a senile woman who abused her children.</p>
<p>In her letter, Andrea Mattson asserts that a savage sex assault occurred either December 1st, or January 2nd. In her two calls to CPS, she asserts the assault took place January 1st. Ms. Mattson says she has a detailed scheduling method. Chloe and I arrived in Mexico on Christmas, and left Mexico on January 1st, during a ferocious rainstorm. All three dates are impossible. Is she my accusor?</p>
<p>There are &quot;early months&quot; to this story which you have not asked about, but perhaps you will. My dialogue with Emily began in her hospital room in March, 2013. Quite a few turning points transpired, including lies that persuaded Emily that Donna was not trustworthy and Darin was scheming. I can recount the specific statements and events that made this clear to Emily. Let me know if you'd like to know exactly what was said to and by me and Emily in our interactions with Donna and Darin during these &quot;early months&quot; prior to November, 2013.</p>
<p>Chloe launched my change of heart when she asked me to &quot;Write another story called 'Chloe and John : our future togEther'&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe has attended Christmas Eve at my sister's home in Olympia since Emily and I met. Chloe has spent the night there every year. My family misses Chloe. Could you allow Chloe to spend a bit of Christmas, Christmas Eve, or some other day with my entire family? I have attached extensive photographic evidence of these relationships.</p>
<p>Candace Zygar claims Chloe is &quot;nervous, etc&quot; in my care, and that I am &quot;a social reject&quot;. Now over 100 pages of visit reports contradict her first claim. On Facebook, where my life updates get 20+ &quot;Likes&quot;, Candace has two Facebook friends. One is Darin Murphy. Why isn't Candace owning up to her declaration by appearing as a witness? Is Candace my accusor?</p>
<p>I remember taking Chloe on the carosel in Westlake park.</p>
<p>&quot;Christine, I had a question about the report on11/23 with Charlotte at the home of Howard Dempsey. Charlotte states that Howard went down stairs to watch sports on TV and Chloe followed shortly after. Mr Dempsey finished cooking the rice and we too returned downstairs. Did she leave Chloe alone with Howard downstairs?. I just want to make sure that Chloe is not to be left alone with anyone while at a visit. Let me know.&quot; Donna is afraid of everyone. Everyone is dangerous, including my uncle, a respected retired junior high school teacher. I have many other instances of Donna feeling afraid: Of downtown Seattle during a bus transfer, of black young men.</p>
<p>Chloe called me dad consistently from age 3 - 6. Only when placed in Donna's custody did she return to John, which she also used when she was 2.</p>
<p>&quot;Grandma says Mom doesn't go to church because they took out the part of her brain that makes her want to go to church.&quot; - Feb or Mar 2014. This is the kind of &quot;believe what I prefer to believe&quot; thinking Donna specializes in. It is untrue and unfair.</p>
<p>Darin gave full support for adoption during November 2013 meeting.</p>
<p>Sarah's three previous reports were mediocre. Previously, she missed important details about Chloe's behavior and indications of Chloe's feelings, yet she included many details that just didn't matter. While the other three supervisors described Chloe's demeaner upon first seeing me (&quot;greeted with hugs and smiles&quot;), Sarah omitted key statements and clues from Chloe indicating or suggesting emotional state.</p>
<p>For example, I only said &quot;I love you&quot; without prompting once in this visit. Chloe initiated &quot;I love you&quot; the remaining times, to which I responded in kind. Sarah documented these interactions incorrectly as flowing solely from me. She did not document that Chloe initiated most of the hugs, but misattributed them to me. I'm convinced she doesn't &quot;see&quot; Chloe in a critical sense. She's too focused on me for some reason I don't understand.</p>
<p>I knew the three other supervisors I'd worked with did a better job, so eventually I began expressing a preference that Sarah not be assigned. Her supervisor eventually asked me why I felt this way. I believe my criticisms may have been shared with Sarah, because she arrived at this visit with a note pad for the first time, and for the first time she wrote a thorough report. However, in addition to false details, this report fails in the same way as the others: Chloe's indications of feelings are still not as apparent to Sarah as they are to the other three supervisors.</p>
<p>Chloe does try to climb on me, and I prevent her from doing so. There are many documented instances of this delicate dance to avoid &quot;prohibited&quot; contacts in past reports and in this one. I do ask us to step back and acknowledge that we are talking about a child who lost her mother 5 months ago. Since age 2, Chloe and I engaged in active play, including dance. Emily, Chloe and I enjoyed visiting Festival of Dance Improvisation (SFADI) in Capitol Hill, Seattle each Sunday, where we and other families developed movement awareness and trust in a bright studio with a mirror wall.<br />
(I have been a member of this dance group for eleven years.) It is clearly absolutely foreign and frightening to Chloe that upon her mother's death, her interaction with me is heavily regulated and limited. She's accustumed to gymnastic activities with me. I've done my best to comply with CFS guidelines about contact, but my primary goal has been to meet Chloe's emotional need for reassurance in this difficult period. It's telling that this report contains a high number of reported violations of contact policy, all of which begin with Chloe approaching me. She clearly enjoys dancing and derives comfort and joy from the experience. This visit was not unusual in this respect. The only change is that Sarah chose to pile on every perceived violation of the policy. (Which only explicitly applies to lap-sitting.)</p>
<p>The claim denoted by Footnote 5 is false, I did not, and do not, add any information beyond what Chloe says about her future plans. The quotation is incorrect. Chloe said she wanted to live in the same house, and I affirmed I would like that, too. I did not add &quot;the same house&quot;; it was in her original statement. I also strongly support her claims of independence, and her wishes for her adulthood. I have never suggested--not in all my life--what she might do when she's an adult, except attend college and establish a career. But when she asserts that freedom can be hers at a certain age, I hear a child longing for her choices to be in her control, and philosophically I have a tough time failing to validate that thinking.</p>
<p>The claim denoted by Footnote 7 is absolutely false. I never made this statement. I never said &quot;I'll get you back.&quot; We were discussing how much I love Chloe, and I said, &quot;You bet I love you. I keep coming back [to see you]!&quot; I would not harm Chloe with a statement like the one attributed to me. I encourage Sarah to sit much closer to us. Most of her livingroom observations were made from across the livingroom and diningroom, a distance exceeding 30 feet.</p>
<p>The sand doesn't turn to mud. It remains sandy. It was my understanding that the goal was not to require a change of clothes, and a change of clothes was not required. I don't question the authority of CFS to conclude visits based on violations of plans or policy, but is there a line of common sense somewhere?</p>
<p>The most serious accusation in this report is based on events which I remember quite differently. When I asked &quot;How many 'i Love yous' and 'how many daddy's?'&quot; she had heard, the supervisor clearly responded with an affirmative. I said my status as Chloe's dad is disputed, and Sarah smiled and clearly said &quot;Oh yes it's clear!&quot; She did NOT say I must stop! So I proceeded to explain why I felt Chloe's feelings deserve a more central role in the reporting: Because I am the subject of a smear, because it's been alleged that I have no legitimate relationship with Chloe or Emily. While I am a passionate speaker, I was in no way out of control, My ultimate motive was to communicate about, and try to understand, why statements about Chloe's emotional context are consistently lacking in Sarah's reports. At some point Sarah did say she would not discuss details of the case with me, so I moved to safer ground: Where are you from? What's your favorite song? How's the weather? I've asked two other supervisors where they're from, and got two answers in the past. I believe most people would receive this subject shift as a clear intent to respect boundaries, but Sarah did not. I want to add finally that her statements opposing discussing where she's from or her favorite song were accompanied by a smirk. What kind of verbal assault victim smirks? I finally laughed to myself because despite my best efforts, I felt alone in the room. Howard Dempsey, owner of the house and retired career schoolteacher, overheard the conclusion of the alleged verbal assault and considered my efforts at calm communication to be appropriate, while her responses were unusual. He describes Sarah as bizarre, cold, and clearly in the wrong job for her skills and traits.</p>

<p>We call it The Choreography of Paranoia.</p>
<p>I've attached a photograph of Chloe with me in the water, and one of her in my lap. So many to choose from! Imagine how confusing this is for Chloe, and how clearly these changes empower Donna's documented campaign of parental alienation. Not that there's much we can do about it, as for now Chloe is in Donna's custody. But at very least I hope we can call this all what it is.</p>
<p>I can convince Chloe it's Fall and splashing around outside isn't going to work anymore. She craves swimming with me indoors, too. But that's not the point. I'm the guy who taught her how to swim, whose lap she's sat in since her 2nd birthday. Are there alternatives to crushing the comforting ties she has left from those early days? I bet you must also be dealing with Donna's pattern of badgering, blaming, and screwing up.</p>
<p>Hypothesis: Donna is playing cheap by trying to use the few tons of hand-me-downs that Epona outgrew. Hypothesis: Donna is gaming the system by trying to �set John up.�</p>
<p>Observation: �Maternal Grandmother stated she had requested that Christine remove me from the case� and I wonder if this was done through the court which ordered the visitation with supervision or is this, once again, ex parte? Did Charlotte know she was persona non grata. There is still a measurable effect of such interference in that any party to an on-going process is impacted by any part of the interaction. And, while I appreciate the heads up on Donna and her paranoia and willingness to game the system, I wonder how one party properly objects to the process and participants in the supervised visitation. Apparently Christine Hanson chose not to be moved by Donna�s pleas and protestations but there are larger issues here.</p>
<p>Observation: �Chloe asked to sit on Mr. Dempsey�s lap� is an indication of Chloe�s need to sit on her Dad�s lap.<br />
This is the same problem in both the geography of communication and in the non-verbal dimension as well as it impacts the volume at which the strictly verbal interaction happens. All communication is at least three levels simultaneously. First there is the geography within which it happens and then there are the plethora of non-verbal cues surrounding the interaction and finally somebody opens their mouth. One of the absolutely best indications of � distance� is when a kid sits on the lap of a cherished adult. I am concerned that the underlying efforts to extinguish the kid�s need for the intimacy satisfied by sitting on laps is being extinguished by the paranoia of adults who are packing a huge load of their own issues stemming from their own childhood betrayals. Very bad situation when the physical is excluded from the process. The physical dimension was one of the key clues to interaction for fully armed rookies studying communication so nobody got shot was what they see. I taught communication for a half century and on many levels and always wonder what definition precludes elements from a process.</p>
<p>Observation: Christine Hanson, by prohibiting �water activities,� is allowing Donna, the maternal grandmother, to game the system by either being incompetent or by deliberate manipulation of the clothing. BTW clothing choices, whether made by a kid or by an adult, are part of the non-verbal communication process. Like laps, water and playing are part of any healthy communication process. Remember that communication has elements of place (geography) and both non-verbalized and verbal elements. If I didn�t believe the beach to be an important part of the experience I would have lived raising kids in a much different way. I was raised at Crescent Beach on the Straits and spent happy hours both wet and sandy while I got sunburned to a crisp. My own kids lived at Lake Sutherland and fond memories carried them to adulthood.</p>
<p>Observation: All Donna has to do now to terminate a visit where Charlotte is to be the supervisor is to pack two bags . One, if inspected will contain inappropriate clothing and the visit will be �immediately terminated.� She avoid ever having to confront anyone over the identity of the supervisor thereby avoiding reporting that is not of her liking. While on that subject we can assume she doesn�t like Charlotte and her evolution as a supervising observer as Charlotte moved from the observer of mundane, and usually trite and trivialized stuff, to a more purposeful documenting of interactions as they occurred between real people. I can assume that Sarah will eventually figure it out and Donna will grow to hate her.</p>
<p>Horrible question: I am fascinated to know what happened to Chloe�s bike as that edges into child abuse. Kid has bike. Dad loves to bike and has frequently done biking with the Chloe and then kid does something maternal grandmother doesn�t like and kid has to sell bike. How do I report that and where is the accounting of the money?</p>
<p>What accusation or claim most accurately characterizes what you consider &quot;the nature of this case&quot;? There are two closed CPS complaints, compliments of Donna's family, both (utterly) unfounded! Have you reviewed those 60 pages and would you like to?</p>
<p>I used to take Emily and Chloe to contact dance, where we all interacted through climbing, dancing, swinging, and spinning around with each other. It was among our favorite things to do. The new rules might be utterly clear to extremists, but they clearly frustrate Chloe, who demands the simple comfort she understood since before she was 2. Can you tell us exactly what the rules are?</p>
<p>The word &quot;inappropriate&quot; flows like water around here, but all &quot;appropriate&quot; behavior seems to do is produce more messed up kids, like ones who lose their mom to cancer and then their dad to bureaucrats.</p>
<p>What accusation or claim most accurately characterizes what you consider &quot;the nature of this case&quot;? There are two closed CPS complaints, compliments of Donna's family, both (utterly) unfounded! Have you reviewed those 60 pages and would you like to?</p>
<p>I describe the nature of this case thusly: Donna and her family make hysterical accusations, raising uproar after uproar, accustomed to wearing people down until they give up. When you give up, Chloe loses. Here's why:</p>
<p>This child, whose diapers I changed, who sat on my lap since before she knew the word &quot;yes&quot;, who I taught to swim, who swam all last summer with me while her mom cheered from the shore, loses more and more of these connections to the past, loses more of the reassuring comfort I've always provided, loses the continuity her mother and i fought for , and i still fight for.</p>
<p>The latest wave is &quot;lap-sitting hysteria&quot; and I am curious where it came from. Kids sit on the laps of cherished adults. The goal is probably to extinguish Chloe's need for the intimacy satisfied by sitting on laps, driven by the paranoia of adults who are packing a huge load of their own issues stemming from their own childhood betrayals. Donna is an extremist. Delivering rigidity.</p>
<p>Today I shopped for child suspenders.</p>
<p>Do not let their underperformance harm her relationship with me.</p>
<p>Every parent I've asked says they've done everything I'm &quot;accused&quot; of doing. Lap-sits, shoulder rides, 6 year olds watching cartoons in their room (with no clothes! shock!). This child has never showed a single indication of experiencing sexual abuse, nor has she ever articulated anything like it. Nor do I have any history of abusing children, nor does anyone in my family. Donna's family, however, has a complex history of abuse.</p>
<p>So we hear lots of rumblings, but never any smoking gun, about my alleged sexual abuse. Ok, what do we clearly see? We see extremists getting their way through badgering, judicial abuse, underperformance, and lots and lots of &quot;there' s a crisis!&quot; handwaving. When you take something from Chloe because Donna can't handle simple details, Chloe loses. Why not ask me to provide suspenders first?</p>
<p>I moved to my brother's home when Emily died and Chloe was taken because he is uniquely qualified to help me at this time. Last year he married in a fun wedding Chloe and I attended. Four months later his wife died suddenly. At the same time, the mother of his daughter produced an enormous, disingenuous, and unsuccessful case for custody opposing him. When you review his and his daughter's DSHS files, you will see a wall of accusations and claims which the court and G.A.L. ultimately rejected.</p>
<p>I consider the resemblance between my year and my brother's 2013 to be uncanny, as I hope you will soon understand. In fact his child's mother recently mentioned me in a new declaration seeking custody by claiming neglect of Epona. Though she is barred from meeting secretly with Epona, she included pictures from secret meetings. She also asserted that I might be responsible for Emily's injury. (I gave Emily brain cancer?)</p>
<p>You now have strong evidence that I've never sexually abused Chloe or any child. Out of necessity, with a wisp of new details in their quiver, the intervenors pivot to a brand new thesis: That I'm violent or threatening. I know my life story. I know I've never hit anyone, never fired a gun, and never threatened anyone with harm. Since I've never done such a thing, there could never be evidence to the contrary. Only innuendo and misappraisal could suggest otherwise. Innuendo and misappraisal can be frightening, but no court can let it suffice. The intervenors have failed to prevail through four hearings; the court has been my strongest ally in the struggle to make evidence and wisdom prevail over innuendo and fear.</p>
<p>Videos have played an unusually central role in the claims of the intervenors. First there was a video I created with Emily and Chloe that I don't believe Donna Mairs has never seen, which she knew for certain showed a serious crime. Now there's a video the intervenors apparently can't stop studying, which I did not create, but only captioned with five words. In the modern era it's strikingly easy to choose the wrong words and click the wrong button, sending the wrong message, a message never intended as it was received.</p>
<p>I must insist that the matter before the court does not hinge on two videos or five poorly chosen words. These are side-shows and distractions from the massive body of evidence submitted in this matter, which includes the declaration of Emily Murphy, over 150 pages of observational reporting prepared by professionals, a declaration from the state's leading expert on people who hurt children with abusive sexuality, and a polygraph from a leading specialist in the field.</p>
<p>Willful misinterpretation is at the heart of both the Intervenor's case and their family psychology. I've seen over decades how Donna Mairs and Darin Murphy fixate on a single detail amidst a sea of details that contradict it. It's how they lie without technically lying. It's psychological abuse based on wrong-headed perfectionism designed to induce crippling shame to control behavior. It is exactly the pattern I have been trained to completely reject when interacting with children. I watched their 4 daughters experience withering criticism built on this unbalanced use of a single detail. I watched them cry as children, feeling ashamed and helpless merely because Donna or Darin built a severely critical interaction based on a single detail of imperfection or error. I watched them abuse their daughters . And I watched what this behavior did to their daughters' self-esteem. Emily insisted this pattern stop with Chloe.</p>
<p>I tried to persuade Emily to change Chloe's guardianship to Darin, rather than Donna. I was naive about how messed up Darin is. Emily said, &quot;I have to go with my gut. Donna is better than Darin. If you don't like it, come change it. Come to Tacoma and be the guardian.&quot; She persuaded me by choosing Donna, because I knew Donna would lock Chloe up. And I'm right: Donna fears not just me, but my uncle, a retired educator, and my father, a retired teacher and police officer. Donna is afraid of the world, black men, Seattle, R movies. I was absolutely right. Donna promised Emily that I would stay in Chloe's life, but then Donna called me a &quot;child&quot; and this made Emily very angry. I think she concluded that she doesn't trust Donna much. If not fake, they are incredibly dishonest, a sort of maliciously fake.</p>
<p>Would you like to contact my family, the people who spent the most time with Emily, Chloe, and me? Most in my family have advanced degrees, most in education, some specializing in at-risk children. My mother taught children Chloe's age for 30 years. She has spent more time with us than anyone else. My family has strong opinions what it's like to watch me be subjected to now 5 investigations, and yet never to be contacted--not one time--to be asked about Chloe's relationship with me. We are heartened to know we will have a trial where we will be heard. I'm not sure there's much use offering you court orders to unlock text messages, if you've never even called my mom.</p>
<p>When I go to putt putt golf, and nobody's around, it's gettin wild time. But certainly that's not my only way of being. That's the enthusiasm she and I have felt for 5 years together, when we first get together, it's hyper. It's simply what you saw when you saw us get together. Play the golf! Crash the car! It's a FUN PLEX. I can't really decide if your prose about my enthusiasm is criticism or not. I just wish you'd see us go bowling, cuz that gets really wild... we cheer regardless of shot. We roll around on the floor with silly enthusiasm. It's one of the things we do. Just one.</p>
<p>And you need to see me, and all of that, for the wholesome love it always has been, for me, Emily, and Chloe together.</p>
<p>I made a party happen in a little scooter box. I got them to the park for outdoor movies, with an inflatable mattress on the bus. I made memories for them. I am still, and for life, obligated to Emily to do so for Chloe. And I'm a loving person with a healthy sexuality. This will be clearer soon. And when it is, I ask you to remember: I'm great in Chloe's life, and Emily worked very hard to keep me there. Since we've met, my step-father has died. Each time he spoke, he said, &quot;I'm praying for you and Chloe.&quot; Please consider the finality of that relationship. And consider the rest, as they too fade from Chloe's mind.</p>
<p>This is the first stretch of her birthday, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's she will be away from both me and my family since she was 2. But I will remain her sole memory of them, until you release me from state's custody, expensive and humiliating, ultimately demeaning because such clear evidence of my love for her, and soon of my overall sexual health. my committment to my duty stands for itself, the more time passes. That's what I think any honest guardian for Chloe would see in striking relief. This is clearly someone who has given a lot of his life to her already. He seems committed to staying that course. Maybe we should give the guy a hug, or a medal, rather than all this shit. He is facing down some messed up people on behalf of two angels. Maybe that guy's fucking great for humanity and country and Chloe Murphy, who says as much about him.</p>
<p>you propose to torture me, make me watch from afar, as the exact catastrophe i fought to prevent comes to pass. i will make sure you know how chloe turns out, confidence crushed from her, just like her aunties. i will live with it forever. i want you to do so, too.</p>
<p>I got her to highly valued therapy. Exceptional therapy. She should resume there. I should be trusted to resume there.</p>
<p>I want to tell you that I see Chloe very actively trying to negotiate the conflict. I am refusing to do this with her, but she seems very eager to resolve matters. She gave a remarkable, vivid metaphorical explanation of things she sees them:</p>
<p>See Chloe position herself as peace-maker, confounded by the conflict, but trapped in it. She is not powerless in this plight. She is assertive, outgoing, committed, and astute. But anyone representing her needs to actively involve her in timely information, not just act on her behalf. I never provide information. Donna provides way too much. But Chloe has accurately inferred there are two options possible, and her life in either--why is she trying to rationalize taking an extremely weak hand? Donna has squished <em>her</em> down to bleak prospects. I want to respond to her, but first I ask you to approve this sort of statement: Don't settle for less than we have now. Settle for much more.&quot; Why is she feeling compelled to negotiate with Donna? Internalize Donna's fears about the big, bad world. I won't settle for that. But she's 7 and I'm 45. I have more practice battling evil, bleak offers. I will make it hard to hold on to such extreme positions.</p>
<p>I do not know what the issues are around this behavior. I know she is trying rather desperately to return to a normal set of relationships beyond this conflict. She also assumes duties considering Donna's offers, relaying them, and trying to negotiate with me. I reject this behavior, and strongly believe it's harmful. It clearly shows Chloe wants to resolve the ongoing conflict and secure the fruits of peaceful family life. She just seems to consistently define me in that family. As did her mom, as do I. So Donna's low-ball offers need to stop reaching Chloe's ears, please. I don't know the psychological implications but this conflict simply has Chloe as its victim, now ferrying offers and attempts at reconciliation. It's hard to explain to her that Donna doesn't cooperate. It's hard to explain to her the full scope of Donna's subversion of free life. Her mother's, now hers. The full scope of that lie will become apparent. It is already apparent to Chloe what the Orca King did. He told a lie!</p>
<p>In a world of the jungle, where no court can help, I would shake Chloe a bit and ask her, &quot;You'd really settle for two nights a month?&quot; Of course not. Nor would I. But I am much more cautious with my words than Donna Mairs. Should her campaign to persuade Chloe to choke me out of daily or weekly life be accepted and ignored? Why is Chloe being asked to rate proposed settlements? Why doesn't Donna propose them to me, and leave the child out of that kind of discussion? I would appreciate that level of respect, as it's disrespectful to ask Chloe about any of that. Of course I know psychological abuse is all about persuasion. You persuade her real good as usual.</p>
<p>Most recently, January 11th she described a sea of two species, the orca whales and the dolphins. She said they did not mix due to a lie told by the king orca a long time ago. She played the role of a mermaid, going between the parties to resolve things.</p>
<p>Prior to this role-play, she explained Donna's &quot;offer:&quot; That I could be allowed to visit twice per month. She asked me if she would be able to visit Donna if she lived with me. I said of course, and explained it was a promise I made to Emily.</p>
<p>This relieved her. However, I said, &quot;It's not in Donna's hands. It's not in my hands. It's not even in your hands. So we don't have to worry about it.&quot;</p>
<p>Obviously she does worry, wishing for a resolution, acutely inferring the nature of the conflict. <em>I do not embellish any of these explanations. She does! I do not.</em></p>
<p>You must evaluate the value of my relationship with her. And maybe since these things are clearly on her mind, and she 's clearly trying to negotiate the gap between Donna and me, maybe you, as her representative in this process, which solely exists to help her... maybe you should contact Chloe and discuss these matters,</p>
<p>as a person who does have a great deal of authority in your hands regarding her future.</p>
<p>She has insisted at various times to talk with you. I'm not sure why the observers omit these requests she makes. I have told her she has a right to speak to her attorney. Specifically that conversation went like this: Supervisor said I could only pass mail to my attorney. Chloe said, &quot;You have an attorney?&quot; I said, &quot;Yes. Her name is Alece.&quot; She said, &quot;I want to talk to your attorney.&quot; I said, &quot;Well, you have an attorney, too. Her name is Tracy.&quot; She said, &quot;I have an attorney? I want to talk to my attorney RIGHT NOW.&quot; I said, &quot;And it's your right to.&quot;</p>
<p>You did meet with her following that conversation. Now that it's clear we will go on for months in court, Chloe deserves an information source that is solely committed to her well-being, including her emotional and psychological well-being during and surrounding matters before the court.</p>
<p>Please consider my view that a uniquely intelligent child needs more than simple reassurance that things will be ok for her.</p>
<p>I am pleased to specify her as a witness in her court cause. But prior to the trial, she deserves assurance and even specific information to the level that Donna and I both receive from our able counsel.</p>
<p>I have a long list of statements Donna has made and continues to make that mislead Chloe about her future. Due to her age, 7, and despite a sound mind, she is unable to discern propaganda from reality in these interactions. Donna Mairs has told Chloe that the portion of Emily's brain that made her want to attend church was removed in an operation.</p>
<p>She has told Chloe that Chloe would reside with uncle and aunt upon Donna and Richard's passing. Ms. Mairs has implied that my family includes bad actors, from whom Chloe must be protected. Donna told Chloe that a future under Donna's authority includes little of me. Obviously Donna lacks all authority to make these kinds of statements, but continues doing so.</p>
<p>So I'm asking you to confer with your client with some additional regularity on matters currently facing the court regarding her future.</p>
<p>I don't know if my case is complex, having no experience in these matters, but I'm told it's a very complex case that will take many more months than usual to resolve.</p>
<p>In that period, please routinely inform Ms. Murphy of developments that impact her, or for which her views may be critical to your decision-making,</p>
<p>and please represent both her needs and her wishes above all other considerations and parties. === TO TRACY BEFORE PSYCHO-SEX EXAM COMPLETED</p>
<p>I believe Donna and Darin both say what they think &quot;will work&quot; at the moment. I suspect this will cause a lot of strange statements when they are faced with the long and complicated story, and explaining their roles in it. Whereas my story is absolutely consistent. Their depositions will be crazy, especially Darin's, because lying persuasively is all he knows. I look forward to it. My family is offended. You haven't helped because you haven't asked anyone what they know. Everything I've explained they would explain. That's how the truth works. But try that with Emily's family and the witnesses against me. Bettina... I have text messages of her saying I'm doing a great job as a parent. And now she's a witness against me? It will be a funny trial.</p>
<p>Allison said in a text message on my phone that the household was &quot;no guidance just shove...&quot;</p>
<p>Meanwhile I've never hurt Chloe. Doesn't that strike you as unbalanced, that I'm so fascinating and they're so messed up that WHAT YA GONNA DO ya throw your hands up and say, &quot;Sorry, Emily.&quot; And shoo me off?</p>
<p>It might help for me to explain in plain language how to understand the period between December, 2012 and November 2013: I was Emily's first pick for Chloe from 2012 and probably before. I thought Donna was a bad choice for Chloe, so I advocated for Darin's home. But Emily thought Darin was a worse choice for Chloe than Donna. We debated for many months. I failed to persuade her. So she said: &quot;If you don't like it, change it. Come to Tacoma and be the guardian.&quot; So I did.</p>
<p>I couldn't live with thinking Donna would be raising Chloe. As for why that is... I think she's a spooky basket case. I certainly think I would give Chloe a much better life, because I am healthier in most every way. Rather than unhealthy or threatening or harmful, I believe I'm healthy and nurturing.</p>
<p>That's been a part deliberately confused in this case: Emily saw and understood all of this. She loved them and me enormously. She still saw serious, dangerous, and destructive flaws of her birth family, in particular her mother and her father. I am not exaggerating or mis-attributing my own conclusions here. Darin made sadistic, seductive, emotional appeals, badgered, schemed, twisted, purjered. He is exactly what she described: Very screwed up. Emily knew these things about Darin, and explained them to me, not the other way around. But she and I were pretty shocked at how far Darin and Donna went to subvert her wish. By the time it was hitting us, with severe psychological violence against us and Chloe, it was too late to move further away. (We originally planned to move to Seattle, but she just didn't think it was realistic.)</p>
<p>I came to Tacoma to raise Chloe at Emily's request. Emily had very sound judgement. Absolutely I'm not perfect! But I am a uniquely trustworthy, generous, wise man. And Emily had serious reasons for her decision, which I know the court will conclude at trial. The court will conclude Emily chose me of her free will, using very sound rationale and very acute awareness, not just of me, but of her parents. And Darin proved to be exactly what she described: Very screwed up.</p>
<p>You both can conclude that Emily was just wrong. That's a question you should ask and answer.</p>
<h2 id="joyce-robson">Joyce Robson</h2>
<p>Joyce is an adoption attorney who prepared the adoption paperwork for John and Emily. Joyce (Joy) viewed both John and Emily as her clients, and initially thought the adoption would sail through. Joy had limited contact with Kyle Coker and made no representations to him about Emily's health. (Coker alleges that no one told him Emily was dying.) According to Joy things started to go sideways when Emily's family became involved. Joy attended a meeting with Joni Irvin, Darin Murphy, Donna Mairs, Jan Dempsey, John and Emily, during which Darin apparently dominated the meeting. Joy thought Darin was the most domineering person she had ever met, and that he was demeaning to his dying daughter, Emily. Joy thought that Jan Dempsey was a voice of reason. Nevertheless, the allegations regarding sexual abuse were sufficient to shake Joni Irvin's confidence in the adoption. Candace Zygar also sent Joni a letter, indicating her reservations about it. Joni apparently told Joy that the court would have to decide whether an adoption was in Chloe's best interest. In any event, Joy asked Joni not to issue a home study or any type of report because she was concerned it would be a negative one. Heather Young refers to the adoption process as a &quot;failed adoption.&quot; Joy disagrees with that description because no home study/report was issued. Joy recently dismissed the adoption petition without prejudice.</p>
<h2 id="howard-dempsey">Howard Dempsey</h2>
<p>Howard is John's paternal uncle. Howard is a retired educator. Many of the supervised visitations have taken place at Howard's home, so he can testify regarding his observations of the bond between Chloe and John. He will be a good witness.</p>
<h2 id="jason-dempsey">Jason Dempsey</h2>
<p>Jason is John's half brother. Jason has shared custody of his own 13-year-old daughter Ebona. After relinquishing the apartment in Tacoma that he had shared with Emily and Chloe, John moved into Jason's home in SeaTac. Jason can testify regarding John's relationship with Chloe.</p>
<h2 id="john-sterbick-j.d.">John Sterbick, J.D.</h2>
<p>John Sterbick had done some legal work for John Dempsey years ago. In the present case, however, he witnessed a statement that Emily signed regarding her wishes for John to have custody of Chloe. John Sterbick went to John and Emily's apartment and will testify that she was competent and clear with respect to her wishes. Curiously, John Sterbick dated Candacy Zygar for about 4 years, I think shortly after she was out of law school.</p>
<h2 id="jeris-underwood">Jeris Underwood</h2>
<p>Jeris Underwood is John Sterbick's paralegal. (There is some odd connection between Jeris Underwood and John Dempsey's mother; Underwood was named after her but I do not believe that Underwood knows the Dempsey family.) Jeris signed a declaration regarding her observations of Emily Murphy, and will testify that Emily was competent and clear with respect to wanting John Dempsey to have custody of Chloe.</p>
