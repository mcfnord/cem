<p>No. Both Jason and I reside in Jason’s house, in separate living areas. This gives opportunities for us to share responsibilities and pool resources, which we do well together. However, I am Chloe’s dad and Jason is an uncle. The relationships are different and I have the final authority, just as Jason has the final authority with regard to Epona.</p>

<p>CPS has investigated me three times and closed each investigation with no finding of abuse. Records regarding the two initial CPS investigations have already been released to you. To the best of my knowledge, records from the most recent investigation have not been released. I have not seen them. I have authorized CPS to release those records to you. If you need a newer authorization form, please let me know.</p>
<p>The following summarizes what I have inferred from the CPS records and/or what I learned from CPS or through you:</p>
<p><strong>Investigation 1</strong> - January 2013 – Andrea Mattson (identified as Emily Murphy's paternal grandmother) claimed I attacked Chloe Murphy by shoving my hand into her shorts while we played during daylight on the sidewalk of a residential Mexican street on January 1, 2013. I believe Andrea also accused me of having an erection while playing with Chloe. Finally, apparently someone at the wedding that we had attended (Darin Murphy married Mariela Murphy in Mexico) claimed to have seen me put my hand under Chloe's dress. As previously stated in my answers to these statements regarding these accusations and in documents filed with the court, not one of these alleged incidents occurred. I never sexually abused Chloe in any way or inappropriately touched her. Furthermore, according to Andrea Mattsen’s account to CPS, I sexually assaulted Chloe on January 1, 2013. On that day torrential rain had turned the streets into streams, everyone was indoors, and as soon as Chloe arrived from spending the night with Mariela’s cousin, it was time to get in the truck and go to the airport.</p>
<p><strong>Investigation 2</strong> - January 2014 – Same accusation, same accusers, same response.</p>
<p><strong>Investigation 3</strong> - May 2014 – CPS took action when a social worker asserted that I had “caregiver collapse” and was concerned that I was unable to care for Chloe Murphy. During the interview, CPS caseworker Camille Johnston relayed the following allegations:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><h2 id="i-speak-to-chloe-using-words-that-mean-the-opposite-of-what-im-saying.">I speak to Chloe using words that mean the opposite of what I’m saying.</h2></li>
<li><h2 id="i-jumped-on-chloe.">I jumped on Chloe.</h2></li>
<li><h2 id="i-bit-chloe.">I bit Chloe.</h2></li>
<li><h2 id="i-asked-chloe-to-perform-a-task-while-she-was-wearing-a-shirt-and-underwear.">I asked Chloe to perform a task while she was wearing a shirt and underwear.</h2></li>
</ol>
<p>These allegations added up to “grooming” to Camille Johnston, she said in the interview. This was the only direct contact that I have had with Ms. Johnston. She never observed me with Chloe and, to the best of my knowledge, did not contact any of my family members or friends about the various allegations. As you know, Ms. Johnston subsequently claimed I was so dangerous that even supervised visits were a harm or threat to Chloe based upon a 46-second video that she never viewed. As noted above, it is my understanding that Ms. Johnston has since closed this third case.</p>
<p>I do not know who made accusation (a) and (d), but for a time I did speak to Chloe with a touch of satire, because she would present fantastic and imaginatively re-engineered notions of the world that conveniently happened to let her have anything she wanted. She’s rhetorically very intelligent. Lampooning the presentation was effective, and I strove not to be sarcastic. I have no recollection of asking Chloe to do any type of task, other that probably getting ready for school or bed, while she wore a shirt and underwear. I certainly never asked Chloe to perform any type of inappropriate task.</p>
<p>I believe accusations (b) and (c) came from Chloe as relayed to a CPS investigator, but rather than “hugging her and biting her neck softly” when she became rowdy, I was containing Chloe and growling and showing my teeth. This was something that Emily Murphy and I did when trying to discipline Chloe. We called this discipline technique “time in” and Chloe can confirm what it is. I learned it from an NPR episode where a child with severe disconnection due to severe neglect was substantially helped by feeling contact and connection with his adoptive parents. In our case, we have used “time in” since Chloe was three when she was trying to assert authority over us. “Time out” is less effective. Instead we would just hold her and assert authority, typically with a great deal of warmth and friendliness. The experience compelled Chloe to “come back to reality” where she was the child and we were the parents again.</p>
<p>I’ve interviewed many parents since I met Camille Johnston. Chloe dressed as every other 6 year old dresses. My mother, with 27 years as a kindergarten teacher, told me that children develop their own modesty starting around age 6. No parent has called Chloe’s activities (such as watching cartoons in her room after a bath and wrapped in a towel) unusual or harmful.</p>
<h1 id="explain-in-detail-the-alleged-sexual-abuse-that-was-perpetrated-against-chloe-by-ally-her-cousin.-explain-to-me-what-you-perceive-to-be-allys-current-values.-give-me-the-dates-the-abuse-occurred-where-it-occurred-how-you-found-out-about-it-what-occurred-what-were-the-consequences-of-the-alleged-sexual-abuse-how-old-was-each-child-at-the-time-of-the-encounters-was-a-cps-report-made-why-or-why-not-was-there-an-investigation-what-was-the-outcome-of-the-investigation">Explain in detail the alleged sexual abuse that was perpetrated against Chloe, by Ally, her cousin. Explain to me what you perceive to be Ally’s current values. Give me the dates the abuse occurred, where it occurred, how you found out about it, what occurred, what were the consequences of the alleged sexual abuse, how old was each child at the time of the encounters? Was a CPS report made? Why or why not? Was there an investigation? What was the outcome of the investigation?</h1>
<h2 id="abuse-overview">Abuse overview</h2>
<p>My understanding, based on information provided by Emily and Chloe, is that once in the attic of Donna’s home, Ally offered Chloe a “real unicorn” in exchange for &quot;tasting&quot; her genitals, or allowing Ally to taste Chloe, or both. In the other instance, a similar experience occurred while they shared a bath. &quot;Tasting&quot; is the word that Chloe used. Emily asked me to “talk about this” with Chloe, and I did. I asked Chloe what happened, and she told me Ally promised her a real unicorn for &quot;tasting&quot; Ally’s vagina in the attic. I asked Chloe what she thought of it and she made a “yuck” face and sound. I told Chloe that she didn't have to do that anymore.</p>
<h2 id="current-values">Current values</h2>
<p>Based on my personal observations of Ally and the many comments that Emily made about her, Ally is immature for her age and plays dumb when she wants something. Ally cries easily and seems emotionally fragile. She is needy, and sometimes acts silly or stupid in order to get attention. I do not mean to criticize Ally, however, Emily was distressed when Chloe spent a lot of time with Ally; Chloe would regress, often acting younger than her age. Emily speculated that Ally would one day wind up pregnant and living on welfare. Additionally, I have concerns that Ally may persist in making inappropriate sexual contact with Chloe.</p>
<h2 id="consequences">Consequences</h2>
<p>I found about the abuse from Emily and Chloe in 2011, when Chloe was 4. I am not aware of a CPS report made about the sexual interactions involving Ally and Chloe. Emily asked me to “talk with Chloe” about it, and I did. In my investigation, I determined that Chloe was tricked into having sexual contact with Ally, and that Chloe did not enjoy it. I explained that she didn’t have to do that again. I also answered Chloe's question regarding unicorns, confirming for her that they are not real, and conveying to her that the incident sounded like a trick Ally played on her to get her to do something she didn’t want to do.</p>
<h1 id="what-was-the-name-of-the-individual-that-offended-ally-when-was-she-offended-how-did-you-find-out-about-it-what-were-the-consequences-of-ally-being-offended-what-happened-to-her-where-was-she-when-she-was-offended-how-old-was-she-at-the-time">What was the name of the individual that offended Ally? When was she offended? How did you find out about it? What were the consequences of Ally being offended? What happened to her? Where was she when she was offended? How old was she at the time?</h1>
<p>Emily told me a friend of Sarah’s (her sister) offended Ally. After they learned of the offense and of the offender’s legal status they ceased giving him access to the family. Chloe also explained to me that there was a man who wanted to be with children so much that he couldn’t control himself. I believe that the offense occurred before Chloe was 4 years old. I do not know any further details.</p>
<h1 id="you-stated-that-jenny-chloes-aunt-dated-a-convicted-sex-offender.-where-did-he-serve-time-in-prison-how-long-what-was-he-convicted-of-did-the-family-know-about-his-past-if-so-how-did-they-handle-that-what-is-brians-last-name-how-do-you-spell-jennys-last-name-do-you-know-how-i-can-reach-her-when-did-she-end-that-relationship">You stated that Jenny, Chloe’s aunt, dated a convicted sex offender. Where did he serve time in prison? How long? What was he convicted of? Did the family know about his past? If so, how did they handle that? What is Brian’s last name? How do you spell Jenny’s last name? Do you know how I can reach her? When did she end that relationship?</h1>
<p>I do not know where Brian served time, or for how long. I know he spoke in more detail to Candace Zygar about his crimes and punishment, and perhaps he also told Jenny Kennaugh (Emily Murphy's sister). Emily Murphy's family knew he had done prison time for sexual offenses against minors. Donna Mairs (Emily Murphy's mother) welcomed him as a guest in her house even after Jenny broke up with him. I believe this occurred before Thanksgiving in 2010 or 2011. (I would have to examine the record to nail this down further.) Jenny’s cellular phone number is: 253-548-4761.</p>
<p>I had strong concerns every time I knew Jenny put this boyfriend in contact with Chloe, and I substantially question Jenny's parenting judgment and setting of boundaries. I also feared when Donna Mairs (Emily Murphy's mother) welcomed Brian into her home even after Jenny had dismissed him.</p>
<p>Brian has also allegedly attempted to drug and rape Jenny’s friend, Beth Nielsen, who described this attack to me in detail during Darin’ Murphy's Tacoma wedding to his current wife Mariela Murphy.</p>
<h1 id="describe-the-incident-in-mexico-when-brian-became-drunk-and-abusive-with-jenny-and-the-consequences-of-this-action.-describe-the-incident-when-he-kissed-chloe-and-the-consequences-of-that-action.">Describe the incident in Mexico when Brian became drunk and abusive with Jenny, and the consequences of this action. Describe the incident when he kissed Chloe and the consequences of that action.</h1>
<p>In Mexico, Brian and Jenny stayed in a tall hotel by the beach. With Darin and me present, Brian became verbally abusive toward Jenny in the apartment. He blamed her for something in a loud and clearly intoxicated manner. We left the apartment. Soon after, Darin told me he had instructed Brian to consume no more alcohol on the trip. He said that there would be more action if Darin learned of any further abuse taking place, including verbal or emotional abuse of his daughter.</p>
<p>Brian was present during a transfer of Chloe from Jenny into my care in a Seattle parking lot. Brian had driven up with Jenny and Chloe. Chloe was only three years old. I saw Brian grab Chloe's head and give her an inappropriate, smothering kiss in the presence of Jenny. I told Brian not to kiss Chloe again.</p>
<h1 id="why-do-you-believe-that-donnas-daughters-do-not-have-their-own-free-will-to-pursue-their-lives-in-the-way-that-they-choose-why-is-it-donnas-fault-if-they-have-not-furthered-their-education-and-interests">Why do you believe that Donna’s daughters do not have their own free will to pursue their lives in the way that they choose? Why is it Donna’s fault, if they have not furthered their education and interests?</h1>
<p>The idea that I find fault with Donna Mairs over something which she has little or no control is inaccurate. Donna's daughters are adults and responsible for their own choices. My concern, however, is that Chloe will not be encouraged, supported or guided to obtain a college education. My concern is based upon my personal observations of Emily Murphy's family over the years, Emily's clear comments, and research. I am also focusing upon this because Emily believed that Chloe would fall through the cracks if left in the care of her biological family. I’m not finding fault with Donna. I’m saying her emotional health, values, and educational background are reflected in the outcomes for her children. These facts concerned and upset Emily for many years. Research strongly links level of college attendance with the female parent. When the parent has not been a college graduate the gap can be closed with an older sibling or a significant adult in the child’s life. I am and have been that significant adult for Chloe.</p>
<h1 id="you-stated-that-you-stopped-using-marijuana-on-march-23-2014.-when-did-you-start-using-it-how-frequently">You stated that you stopped using marijuana on March 23, 2014. When did you start using it? How frequently?</h1>
<p>I have checked my records and can accurately place this change on March 17<sup>th</sup>, 2014, not March 23<sup>rd</sup>.</p>
<p>I started using marijuana when I was 25 years old. At age 25 I had severe computer overuse syndrome including carpal tunnel syndrome, which manifested in extreme pain in my hands and neck. I used it periodically, with months of cessation. Around 1999 I tried Bikram yoga, also called hot yoga. At first it was extremely painful but effective treatment for my hand and neck pain. In 2003 I developed techniques for working with computers while lying down, which substantially reduced the impact of computer use on my neck. In 2007 I began doing Bikram yoga in the sauna at the YMCA. In 2009 I began pain treatment, rolfing, with Mark Pearlscott. My use of marijuana reduced over the decade as I discovered these pain prevention techniques. However I continued to use marijuana frequently until October 2013.</p>
<h1 id="when-is-the-last-time-that-you-and-each-of-the-murphy-daughters-use-marijuana">When is the last time that you and each of the Murphy daughters use marijuana?</h1>
<p>Times we last used marijuana together:</p>
<h2 id="sarah-emily-murphys-sister">Sarah (Emily Murphy's sister)</h2>
<p>Sarah offered me her pipe and lighter at Dash Point Park while camping around 2011. Sarah gave marijuana oil as a 2013 Christmas gift to Emily Murphy and to me, but I think the last time I used marijuana with Sarah was at Dash Point Park when she offered it in her tent where she and Emily were getting high.</p>
<p>Emily Murphy occasionally provided marijuana oil she said came from Sarah through her medical card.</p>
<h2 id="melissa-emily-murphys-sister">Melissa (Emily Murphy's sister)</h2>
<p>I am sure Melissa and I shared marijuana in the past but no specific instance comes to mind. It must have been prior to 2013.</p>
<h2 id="jenny-emily-murphys-sister">Jenny (Emily Murphy's sister)</h2>
<p>I shared a joint with Jenny and Emily in 2009 in Mexico. The marijuana was provided by Darin Murphy (Emily Murphy's father) through his wife Mariela Murphy (Emily’s step-mother).</p>
<h2 id="emily-murphy">Emily Murphy</h2>
<p>Emily and I last used a small amount of marijuana together on or before March 16<sup>nd</sup>, 2014.</p>
<h1 id="where-and-from-whom-did-you-obtain-marijuana">Where and from whom did you obtain marijuana?</h1>
<p>Of the parties involved in this case, I obtained marijuana from Emily Murphy, her sister, Sarah, and her father and stepmother, Darin and Mariela.</p>

<h2 id="emily-rose-murphy">Emily Rose Murphy</h2>
<p>2009 – 2011, 2013-2014. I began dating Emily in 2009. We were apart for a while, particularly during the time that I was dating Melissa Burchett, but experienced a significant shift in our relationship in 2013. Emily asked me to move in with her and to be her &quot;last boyfriend.&quot; Emily was a fierce, funny, and beautiful person. We fell in love unlike any I’ve felt before. The relationship ended with her death, but often I think it’s still with me strongly. I remain committed to her and to her clear wishes.</p>
<h2 id="melissa-sue-burchett">Melissa Sue Burchett</h2>
<p>2012 – 2013 Mel and I dated for about a year. Mel kept breaking up with me every few weeks, and then changing her mind. She correctly identified that I loved both Emily Murphy and Chloe, which I believe threatened her. I initially ignored that rocky stuff, but it all got to me eventually so I ended the relationship.</p>
<h2 id="akiko-oguchi-r.n.">Akiko Oguchi, R.N.</h2>
<p>2004 – 2008. I was involved with Akiko during her 4-year nursing training at Seattle University. Our relationship ended because we were unable to get past barriers to openness, many I attributed to cultural differences around openness. I went to Mexico to get free of the memory of her. That’s when I met Chloe Murphy.</p>
<h2 id="roya-k.-naini">Roya K. Naini</h2>
<p>2002 – 2003. Roya is a pinball champion. While I dated her, she started a punk rock band. She likes making analog photography and creating music. I think she just grew out of me.</p>
<h2 id="jessica-benezra">Jessica Benezra</h2>
<p>2001. Jessica taught second grade. I met her the same day I decided to leave Brooklyn, New York. I spent two months with her. Jessica considered moving to Seattle. However, Jessica is Jewish and would miss her family.</p>
<h2 id="ashley-balabanoff">Ashley Balabanoff</h2>
<p>2001. Ashley lived in Brooklyn, New York. We dated while she studied acting. Our relationship ended when I had to return to Seattle.</p>
<h2 id="anja-winter">Anja Winter</h2>
<p>1998-1999. Anja was an <em>au pair</em> from Germany on assignment in Seattle. She had to return to Germany, and I visited her in Berlin. We did not pursue a long-term relationship due to the obvious issues of distance and time. We correspond occasionally.</p>
<h2 id="dawn-michelle-devine">Dawn Michelle Devine</h2>
<p>1997, 2000. I dated Dawn during three separate periods. This was not a serious relationship.</p>
<h2 id="dena-reaugh">Dena Reaugh</h2>

Please state when Ms. Murphy was present during these interludes.</h1>
<p>This question is overly broad. I have known Chloe Murphy since she was 22 months old, which is now well over five years. Nevertheless, I will do my best to summarize my numerous contacts with Chloe and her mother Emily Murphy.</p>
<p>When I dated Emily Murphy, we three would be together almost all weekends. Emily kept clothes, a toothbrush, and other items at my house as we both looked forward to time together and rarely missed it. We were together through two trips to Mexico (each over a week), and one trip to New York City (over a week). We spent all major holidays together, often visiting her mother and my own in the same day.</p>
<p>Even when I dated Melissa Burchett, I invited Emily and Chloe to family events. Emily and I maintained a commitment to being Chloe’s parents and being each other’s friend. Emily and Chloe always camped one or two nights with my family on 4<sup>th</sup> of July, but when I dated Melissa in 2012, Chloe accompanied Melissa and me to the family holiday campout. Once Emily couldn’t accompany me to Christmas Eve at my sister Jan Dempsey’s house, where we always spent the night, so Chloe accompanied me without Emily. We attended three birthday parties for Epona (my niece) at Gasworks Park, but Emily missed it on one occasion while Chloe attended.</p>
<p>A very common routine would be for Emily and Chloe to spend the weekend with me, and then Sunday night we would all visit my mom, Jeris Ockfen. We probably did this 30+ times together over the years. I also visited my mom just with Chloe on occasion.</p>
<p>When Chloe was 3, I began video-chatting with both Emily and Chloe on Skype. Through some periods Emily would call me every day after work so I could talk to her and Chloe. When Emily and I stopped dating, we would all still talk on Skype, often at Chloe’s request. We would coordinate visits to Seattle for Chloe to spend time with me. Chloe spent a few nights without Emily at my first apartment. Then I moved to a small apartment on Capitol Hill, where Chloe also visited and spent the night. Chloe developed relationships with two other children in the building, and I would take all of them to the park, both with and without Emily present. I estimate that I spoke with Chloe at least 20 times a month, visited her at least 4 times a month, and coordinated an overnight visit at my apartment twice a month.</p>
<p>In 2013 my relationship with Emily returned. I believe their first return to Seattle together was March 30, 2013. In April Chloe was with me at my half-brother’s wedding, and that was her first visit to the improvisational singing group where I would take her with and without Emily at least eight more times.</p>
<p>My romantic relationship with Emily resumed July 4<sup>th</sup>, 2013 during our family camping trip. I spent time with them both throughout the summer of 2013, nearly every weekend. I always believed in making people travel the least, and Emily went through a tough phase in early 2013 with limited mobility due to weight gain from heavy steroids. So I would take a bus or ZipCar to Tacoma, then take Chloe to the Kandle Park wave pool. Emily was usually with us during these swimming visits, but Emily did not swim. I would swim with Chloe and then visit with Emily, who would sit in the shade and snack on fruit, juice, etc. That is when Emily began asking me to move to Tacoma.</p>
<p>By October, 2013 it was clear Emily was deteriorating as she became more tired. Logistics of getting around became more complicated, mostly due to fatigue. We tried to make the best of the facts. Frequently she would come to my apartment by bus, relax and sleep, while I would take Chloe for a walk, or we would meet up with four different neighbors in our building, two with children her age, one who played many instruments, and Daniel Masler, a child psychotherapist. Emily would have some energy to walk a few blocks for some Mexican food. Then we’d all come home and go to bed for the night. The next day we would make a short family trip to a fun place such as a park, and then perhaps downtown to the Tacoma bus. Sometimes Chloe would stay another night. It was all figured out on the spot, based on Emily’s wellness and energy level, and other factors.</p>
<p>I have always communicated to Chloe that I value serious studies, so I always came to school open house for pre-school, kindergarten, and first grade, kindergarten graduation, and other events (“Dads and Dogs,” school musical assemblies, award assemblies, “Math and Book Night” during 1<sup>st</sup> grade). I was with Emily most of the time at these school events. Starting January 2014, I became Chloe’s sole transportation to and from school, and primary representative with her teacher and guidance counsellor. At that time Emily became so tired that I was the primary care-giver for them both, doing my best to keep the household together, but always deferring to Emily, and showcasing her, because I knew these times would be Chloe’s last memories of her. I was the day-to-day care-giver, while Emily was a special person with whom we tried to share special moments, singing, playing badminton in the house, eating the dinner I cooked, and just being together whenever she had energy.</p>
<p>Another way to answer this question is to note memories of places where I was with one or both of them. Emily said regularly that memories are a critical part of a good childhood. I strove throughout Chloe’s childhood to expose her to places and experiences that interested her. I find these memories coming to me everywhere I go throughout Seattle, and it’s often easy to remember whether Emily accompanied Chloe and me.</p>

How long did this type of lifestyle occur? How and when did you become aware of it? Please give me the names and phone numbers of the individuals that told you about this.</h1>
<p>I learned this from William Houts, Emily’s friend Allison, and from Donna Mairs.</p>
<p>William Houts (253-582-4763) relayed to me that he walked in on Donna having sex with his boyfriend around 1988. Donna invited Mr. Houts to join in.</p>
<p>Allison (253-279-7250), a childhood friend of Emily’s, was prohibited by her parents from visiting the Murphy home due to what she described as an “anything goes” philosophy. I don’t hold this view. Instead I saw a strange mix of strictness, social insularity, and party activity. Allison told me that LSD parties and sex parties occurred.</p>
<p>When I was about 22 Donna typed to me in an erotic way using a computer-to-computer interface.</p>
<p>When I began dating Emily, she lived with Chloe in a small apartment. Later she moved in with Donna and Richard to save money and get some help with Chloe. I was reluctant to visit Donna’s home because it seemed Donna didn’t like me. Donna called me and explained that she knows I saw her do “immoral things” in the past, and she felt ashamed. I said I do not recall seeing her do anything she might consider immoral.</p>
<p>Around 1992 Darin hosted parties where young people he knew would drink and party. I saw a young, drunk woman (Kim Swanson) who might have been under 21. Darin assured she laid correctly so she would not drown in vomit. I don’t know where she acquired alcohol.</p>
<h1 id="describe-in-detail-what-you-observed-and-know-about-the-strip-club-that-you-and-others-attended-in-mexico.">Describe in detail what you observed and know about the strip club that you and others attended in Mexico.</h1>
<p>The strip club’s name was Hysteria. It is a known tourist destination in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. The dancers performed one at a time on a catwalk while staff pushed overpriced drinks to intoxicated Americans. Then performers offer to dance in laps in exchange for bracelets purchased on the customer’s tab. I would describe it as dimly lit. Darin Murphy (Emily's father) made arrangements for some of us to go to Hysteria. Darin took us to the club without warning. I had never been there. Darin told me that all dancers in the club sold sex, even those who say they do not. I don’t know if Darin had been there before. He did say he had been to the “local” strip bars in Puerto Vallarta, which he characterized as friendlier than the tourist-oriented Hysteria.</p>

How old were all of the participants? Who else was present? Where were you? Who arranged the outing? Why did you choose to attend? Who cared for Chloe when you were in attendance? What did Darrin’s future spouse say about the event?</h1>
<p>While at Hysteria with Darin Murphy and the other members in our group, I sat in a chair at the end of some small drink tables. A stage was to my left, along the left side of the little tables in front of me. Along the right side of these tables sat Mark Deutsch, then Melissa Vulliet, then Rob Vulliet, then Mariela Murphy (Darin's wife). Darin Murphy sat in a chair you might say was at the other end of the tables, face-to-face to me but at some distance (the distance of four adults sitting side-by-side).</p>
<p>I saw Mariela and Darin engage in sexual contact with at least two strippers/prostitutes (&quot;entertainers&quot;) while drinking distilled alcohol. Darin kissed and touched at least one stripper all over, who kissed and touched him all over. Darin's third daughter Melissa and her husband Rob also employed entertainers for sexual contact while drinking distilled alcohol. I only drank a single rum and Coke, and did not purchase sexual stimulation. However, in talking with an entertainer, <em>I</em> offered <em>her</em> a lap dance, which she accepted. It was tasteful and included little touching, and she laughed, I think sincerely. Darin brought us all in the same vehicle to the club without warning. I would not have joined if informed of the destination. During the evening I only practiced Spanish with the entertainers I met, and provided modest compensation for their time.</p>
<p>I estimate all participants to be in excess of 20 years of age. The two I spoke with were single moms. Chloe stayed with Mariela Murphy’s family while we were away. Darin Murphy said later that a stripper he hired there asked for 25 (pesos or dollars) to get cocaine. He told us that he declined. Mariela Murphy said to me later that extramarital sexual relations were ok with her so long as she remains the primary partner.</p>
<h1 id="describe-in-detail-darrin-and-the-physical-punishment-of-chloe-in-mexico.">Describe in detail Darrin and the physical punishment of Chloe in Mexico.</h1>
<p>Darin's current wife, Mariela, is from Mexico. Chloe danced at a party celebrating the wedding of Mario and Soledad, Mariela’s parents. Chloe was not yet 2 years old. She danced so hard that her skin was chafed by friction from her pants and diaper. Chloe cried in the car as we drove home from the party. Darin drove. Emily, Melissa, Rob, and I were passengers. Chloe would not stop crying. At that time in her life Chloe was barely verbal, so we did not know what was wrong. Darin stopped the car and spanked Chloe hard, causing her to cry much more loudly. Later we determined that Chloe was crying because she had chafed, irritated skin. During a car ride in Tacoma years later, Darin again threatened spanking to gain Chloe's compliance.</p>
<h1 id="tell-me-all-that-you-know-about-darrin-murphy.">Tell me all that you know about Darrin Murphy.</h1>
<p>This is a very broad question. I’ve known Darin Murphy (Emily's father) since I was a teenager when we both ran our respective bulletin board systems on computers in the mid-80’s. I then was his personal assistant after I graduated from college, in 1993. I looked up to him as a role model and friend, and he taught me many of the skills I still use today in my career. So, so my answers could go on for a book. I’ve tried to focus on things I know that seem related to this investigation.</p>
<h2 id="emily-murphy-said-these-things-about-her-father-darin-murphy">Emily Murphy said these things about her father, Darin Murphy:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>“I want to give you every tool you could need to keep Dad from interfering with the plan for Chloe.”</p></li>
<li><p>Emily told me Darin carried on sexual relations with both Donna and Dina (Darin’s second wife) in the same period of time.</p></li>
<li><p>Around January 2nd, 2014, Darin rang Emily’s phone and mine after bedtime. He refused to communicate via text. He explained his car was in the shop, and he needed to borrow hers. She cried as he drove over, and said, “He thinks he can just show up. Then he can go back to his family. It’s not fair.” I held her to comfort her.</p></li>
<li><p>The second time she cried, her father had taken her for a drive. During the drive he explained his view that she was being abused. She came home and began crying when I hugged her. She said, “I like how we talk about our feelings here.”</p></li>
<li><p>Darin is very charming to strangers. In Madigan hospital, as Emily and I tried to get a urine sample, we listened to Darin charm an old man. This annoyed Emily, because she sensed the friendliness was all contrived. Emily had an attraction to authenticity and the truth. She said “You never get to know what Darin really thinks. He only shows you what he wants to show you.”</p></li>
<li><p>She made a rule that we were not to discuss her father in the house.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="darin-murphy-said-these-things-to-me">Darin Murphy said these things to me:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>“I felt manipulated.” –This was Darin’s response to the meeting at Howard Dempsey’s, suggesting I should feel guilty. Guilt is the family national anthem. In that meeting, Emily and I floated the idea that Darin and Mariela raise Chloe. At that meeting, at the end, Darin asked, “What’s in it for you, John?” This seemed like a strange question to me. In a previous interaction he had already agreed that there are mental health problems at Donna’s home. I wanted to help Chloe reach a safer, healthier environment. What did he think my motive <em>might</em> be? Of course in his declarations he argues that my intention was to secure access to Chloe so I could sexually victimize her.</p></li>
<li><p>“This elevator is inadequate for Emily’s needs.” - Suggesting I should defer to his authority on adequacy of elevators. He said we should move.</p></li>
<li><p>“I want her to have some comfort. I’m supporting my daughter! What are you doing?” - Suggesting I should feel guilty and that he’s the righteous one. Actually this is his only statement that had an impact on me.</p></li>
<li><p>“You’re paying a pretty penny!” - Suggesting I should defer to his authority on real estate rental rates. In fact, the rent was not high, was stable (all utilities except electricity included), the view was lovely, and the location was about as convenient and fun as Tacoma gets. Emily paid less per month than she paid to Donna. Square footage is not the only way to think about real estate. Emily said about this comment, “Where was he when we were looking for a place?” He was in Mexico. After we had signed a lease, he appeared to want us to move, for reasons I do not think related to his stated reasoning. Emily was proud of our apartment and we chose it well.</p></li>
<li><p>Once in Mexico I paid for everyone’s meal. He said, “You’re a good guy, John. Others might not know it, but I know it.” He ostensibly was kinda joking, but it seemed like a strange, demeaning statement masked as a joke. I had, after all, paid for everyone’s lunch.</p></li>
<li><p>Darin disregarded Emily's clear and consistently stated wish for full resuscitation and life support. He described this change to me as being &quot;easier for the family, including Chloe.&quot; He also justified this to my father and step mother in a conversion for which I was not present. In that conversation, my step-mother asked, “Is this about cost?” Darin did not respond.</p></li>
<li><p>On two occasions Darin described Andrea (Emily’s grandmother) as being “manic”. Once she was making urgent requests for food or cooking purchases that Darin would not satisfy, because she was being “manic” in his view.</p></li>
<li><p>Darin sought Emily’s cellular phone one week before her death. He said this was “in case her friends call”. This did not make sense to me, as Emily had stopped answering her own phone regularly over a month prior. Her friends would call me, and I had referred them all to Mariela’s phone. So what friends was he referring to? How would she answer? As well, I knew her phone was an authentication key to her financial, social, and personal accounts, such as email, Facebook, and Tapco. She had entrusted me with her finances and email as her Financial Power of Attorney, and as the Executor of her Estate. It was not financially prudent to release this authentication key to any other party for any reason. I explained this position twice. His response was: “John! John! Her cell phone is her cell phone!” He then hung up as I responded politely that the device would not leave my custody. He continued demanding it in person, using notes. Had she sought to entrust her finances and personal communications to him, I imagine she would have placed him in these legal roles, or provided him with passwords. Based on his hostility and my understanding of Emily’s friendships, I doubt his stated motive—that friends might call. Call forwarding could solve that problem, for example.</p></li>
<li><p>Darin told me his second wife stole from him (~$100,000) and he worried she was plotting to kill him, so the family of his third wife asked if he needed her killed. He said he declined.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="deeds">Deeds</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Once during a visit to Darin’s home, probably Emily’s last visit on her own two feet, I read a book to Chloe while Darin worked on some computer task. Mariela asked him if he was sure he wanted to work rather than just talk to us. He worked instead, sort of talking while he worked, and drove away to deliver a package at the FedEx or UPS office. Emily commented later that Darin didn’t notice me reading to Chloe, and this seemed to make Emily angry or disgusted. I think she tried hard to make her parents understand and accept her choice regarding me and Chloe. She would note with disappointment every time I was obviously doing healthy things with Chloe which they (especially Darin) didn’t seem to see.</p></li>
<li><p>Darin claimed vocally and repeatedly both Emily and Chloe were experiencing abuse. He worked two blocks away from our apartment on Tacoma Avenue, yet he rarely visited.</p></li>
<li><p>Darin says severely critical things in meetings that he does not say in private, one-on-one, conversations. Many times he had a cheerful conversation with me one-on-one, and shortly afterward he would severely criticize and accuse me in a meeting of authorities. He never discussed his serious allegations with me. In fact he carried on with me privately as if we were friends.</p></li>
<li><p>Once I made him laugh. It was after he made the far-reaching allegations at the second adoption meeting, where he asserted that I don’t sleep with Emily, in her bed. Soon thereafter he was at my house, and I explained where I sleep, “contrary to popular myth.” This made him laugh, I believe because he knew his claim was a fabrication.</p></li>
<li><p>Darin is charismatic and can read people.</p></li>
<li><p>Darin never used the apartment call box. He always snuck into the building and arrived at the apartment door. He rarely called ahead, and never called me, even though I was Emily’s care giver.</p></li>
<li><p>When Emily relocated, Darin prepared a POLST (Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment) form that specified no resuscitation efforts to be made (Do Not Resuscitate, DNR). A POLST form is not valid unless signed by a physician. I only saw the unsigned POLST hanging in Emily’s room. The signed form was hidden under other papers on the kitchen refrigerator. Emily confirmed with me many times that she wanted all forms of life extension and resuscitation.</p></li>
<li><p>During a trip to San Francisco paid for by the Wounded Warrior Fund, a private fund for injured marines, I bought everyone's lunch. Darin asked for my receipt, explaining the Fund would compensate him.</p></li>
<li><p>At Emily's internment Darin shook hands and asked my older brother, &quot;you are John's brother? I hope we can put this family conflict behind us.&quot; His activity in court showed no intention of doing so at that time.</p></li>
<li><p>At the 2<sup>nd</sup> adoption meeting, Darin interrupted my sister to object to the tone of her voice. My sister is very level headed, reasonable, and considerate. She is a project manager for a multinational corporation. Darin often employs various techniques to attempt to control meetings. He will be totally cheerful one on one and vicious in a meeting moments later. All of his behavior is an act intended to control others. Nothing is genuine. This is consistent with Emily's view that her parents are “fake.”</p></li>
<li><p>Darin reached a rank where he was the commander of fire stations. All personnel in the station were under his command. Then he switched to answering 911 calls.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="relationships">Relationships</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Darin said his 2<sup>nd</sup> wife Dina isolated him and he believed this was what Emily was experiencing. I have many photos of Emily with friends during this period, but Darin stayed away.</p></li>
<li><p>Darin described his second wife Dina as controlling, and said she isolated him from friends and family. Emily confirmed that she prevented Darin from attending the wedding of Sarah and Greg. Darin showed an example of a photograph where she had cut Donna out of a picture where Donna posed with her daughters.</p></li>
<li><p>Dina was angry with Darin for watching pornography. She believed he needed therapy to cease this pattern. He disagreed.</p></li>
<li><p>Darin discussed the availability of hit men in Mexico, where he owned a time-share condo in the more-American part of town, north of Puerto Vallarta. (Nuevo Vallarta.) He called his condo and someone answered, which was unexpected. Darin believed his wife to be ruthless and greedy, and he believed his status as her spouse might incentivize her to have him killed so she would receive both assets and fire department pension. Some member or members of Mariela’s family reportedly asked if he needed to have someone “taken care of” and he declined this offer. Darin explained that Mexico is a place where people just “disappear”.</p></li>
<li><p>Emily was Darin's favorite daughter. He worked hard to get her to surgery in San Francisco many times.</p></li>
<li><p>Darin associated with Ted Fix, who was convicted and imprisoned for modifying and selling firearms in an unlawful way.</p></li>
<li><p>Donna complained to me when I was about 21 that Darin did not spend adequate time with his children, and asked me to discuss it with him.</p></li>
<li><p>Darin maintained sexual relationships with both Dina (who would be his second wife) and Donna in the same period, according to Emily.</p></li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><p>Darin and Kyle Coker had no previous association that I am aware of, and Kyle expressed hostility toward him in my conversations with Kyle.</p></li>
<li><p>Kyle identified in court that Darin was planning to host him for a visit in late August. Heather Young asked Commissioner Johnson if he would like to hear from Darin about the plans to host Kyle.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="weapons">Weapons</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>In the past Darin Murphy had an extensive cache of firearms, knives, and NATO-issue night vision binoculars. When I worked for him, I believed he was armed adequately to outfit a militia. He stored these weapons in his attic office, which was frequently unlocked. I do not know if the weapons were loaded.</p></li>
<li><p>Darin was a member of the Washington State National Guard, where he maintained skills as a marksman.</p></li>
<li><p>Darin owned property in rural Piece County where he fired guns and detonated explosives.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="do-you-believe-that-chloe-should-have-unsupervised-contact-with-darrin-murphy-why-or-why-not">Do you believe that Chloe should have unsupervised contact with Darrin Murphy? Why or why not?</h1>
<p>Yes, but with substantial reservations. Chloe does not show an interest in Darin Murphy. Furthermore, I agree with Emily that Darin is emotionally very damaged. He uses impressive charisma to persuade people to believe and help him. Emily said many times Darin has no relationship with Chloe. Emily just saw “grumpy grandpa,” as she put it. I believe Darin might spank Chloe painfully just to show her how much pain is available from him. I believe he would need actual custody to do substantial harm to Chloe.</p>
<h1 id="describe-in-detail-why-you-state-that-you-engage-in-play-therapy-with-chloe-during-your-encounters-with-her.">Describe in detail why you state that you engage in “play therapy” with Chloe during your encounters with her.</h1>
<p>Play therapy is one of the ways that I engage Chloe. I have prepared Chloe for her mother’s death and her bereavement for a long time. Specifically I prepared her to accept me as her new primary care-giver by strengthening our relationship. I wanted her to understand she had a non-judgmental, committed, unflappable adult in her life who puts her first and accepts her as she is.</p>
<p>I am neither a professional educator nor a professional therapist. However, I reflected on the purpose and focus of my relationship with Chloe over the many years it has evolved. Ultimately I embraced the necessity that I must maintain a strong, healthy, parental relationship informed by my experience and understanding of her emotional needs.</p>
<p>I have exposure to theories of personality development and fundamentals of therapy through university-level study, personal relationships with therapy professionals, and professional relationships with therapists and counselors who understood Chloe’s needs during Emily’s illness and Chloe’s parental bereavement. I also have hands-on experience with children, including children with special needs, including academic and volunteer engagements at all age levels.</p>
<p>The more kids can play in their lives the more they can be kids. Of course that may overly simplify the rather technical therapeutic meaning of the term &quot;play therapy&quot; but it implies that I’m willing to let kids express themselves as kids while I get to be a part of their world. When possible, they get to set the terms of the playing.</p>
<p>While not a professional therapist, I put a great deal of thought and intention into my relationship to Chloe, with special emphasis on her emotional needs, and with focus on building a relationship that would help her weather the painful experience of losing Emily.</p>
<h1 id="define-play-therapy-and-what-it-means-to-you.">Define “play therapy” and what it means to you.</h1>
<p>Play therapy uses play to communicate with and help children, especially those experiencing psychosocial challenges. In Chloe Murphy's case, she recently lost her mother and has had only limited contact with me, the only father she has known. Children are unique from adults in that children understand play intuitively, while adults are often alienated from their own impulsivity and playfulness by “socialization” into “responsible” behavior. Children tend to reveal exactly what’s going on in their mind because the window into their mind and soul is unfogged and clean as they engage in play. It just takes some observation and provision of symbols they can work with.</p>
<p>I group play therapy into different forms.</p>
<p><strong>Play Therapy:</strong> Least structured. The younger the child, the more straightforward the symbols are. Mom, dad, me, home, fear.</p>
<p><strong>Art and Music Therapy:</strong> More structured, more dialectical, more able to draw on cultural signposts such as existing songs.</p>

How long have you employed this style of encounter? Is (are) there any other ways that you choose to engage with her? If so, what?</h1>

Describe in detail these incidents and when, where and why you believe this happened.</h1>
<p>After the death of her mother, on June 20<sup>th</sup> Chloe created a beautiful sand sculpture with adorning shells and seaweed attire. She then aggressively destroyed the sculpture while explaining, “The queen died, the castle fell, and the king and the princess were blasted apart.”</p>
<p>In two recent visits (October and November, 2014), Chloe was a princess endlessly striking down warriors. It's her attraction to this play that stands out. Chloe may see herself as an intrepid and divinely ordained warrior against an army of opponents. While not unusual for her age, the symbolism may be particularly resonant for her current position as a child feeling weak against adults fighting around and over her.</p>
<p>On August 24<sup>th</sup>, she assigned me to be an animal and asked me to reside with her under the deck. Actually I found it cold under the deck so I moved into the sun. I said (in character) that I preferred to live here. She became passive aggressive, saying I could choose to live there but I would be eaten by animals and she would not feel sad for me when that occurs, because I declined her help. I expressed sadness and surprise that she would not feel sad for me. I asked if she could simply move into the sun also. After determining guilt and fear were not effective, she became more empathetic and decided to instead build a &quot;house&quot; next to mine and protect me.</p>
<p>In another role-play invented August 24<sup>th</sup> and repeated on two other visits, Chloe calls me “momma” and I know we are bobcats. The momma bobcat declined to tell the baby what a daddy is, so the baby is confused. This play corresponded with telephone calls from Chloe’s biological father where he said he finally wanted to meet her. This was incredibly hard (and very confusing) for Chloe! She manifested it in play where she could explore what it might mean.</p>
<p>Beginning in January, 2014, I would find Chloe sitting in the closet or clubhouse with stuffed animals all facing her. In this place she would discuss Emily’s cancer. When I saw this configuration of toys, I knew the discussion to be very serious. I visited very calmly and quietly. My goal was to hear how she feels, support her feelings with love and understanding, and reassure her that she would be ok and would be taken care of. That message was taught to me by grief counsellors as the most important message for a child facing parental bereavement.</p>
<p>When the school year began, Chloe started pretending she needed crutches because “I tripped on Stanley,” a dog. Around that time, Donna transferred Chloe from Jefferson to Stanley Elementary School. I asked if there was a dog named Grant, and one named Bryant, as those are schools where Emily and I applied for her to enroll in the 2<sup>nd</sup> grade, before CPS placed Chloe in Donna’s care. Chloe said those were wiener dogs, and Howell (another school we considered a backup) was a pony. She brings up this story routinely: She’ll find something that looks like a crutch (such as the golf putter), and begin limping, explaining, “I tripped on Stanley.” When played out at my mother’s house, my mother’s bedroom becomes the “princess hospital” where princesses recover from tripping on dogs named Stanley.</p>
<p>In the November 1<sup>st</sup> visit, she drew a floor plan for the house where she wished to reside, which included a room for me and one for her.</p>
<p>While role-playing on November 8<sup>th</sup>, Chloe invented a “laughter institute” where people go to laugh. Then she invented an “anger institute” where people go to get angry. We simulated growing levels of anger toward each other and the world in general. At a point during the role-play, she switched into a deeper level of authenticity, and said, “It’s not even about me! It’s just about the money!” I don’t know what this might be about, and it’s important not to draw conclusions based on a single detail, but I think this might be part of something she is perceiving as going on around her.</p>
<p>I believe these are straightforward manifestations of Chloe’s inner-dialogue, which she communicates to me due to substantial trust we share.</p>
<h1 id="why-are-you-an-advocate-of-play-therapy">Why are you an advocate of “play therapy?”</h1>
<p>Self-expression through play can heal emotional wounds. In Chloe Murphy's case I will take this a bit further: People of unusual creativity and intellect have the same joy in their smiles and salt in their tears, but also have the capacity to <em>define</em> these things, and the emotional imperative to do so to remain healthy. Play, art, and music therapy have helped Chloe tremendously.</p>
<h1 id="should-all-parentspeople-learn-this-technique-and-engage-with-children-in-this-fashion-why-or-why-not">Should all parents/people learn this technique and engage with children in this fashion? Why or why not?</h1>
<p>There's nothing to be gained from a lack of perspective. So, it would probably be helpful for most parents to learn about play therapy, particularly with children who have lost a parent.</p>
<h1 id="who-else-do-you-know-that-engages-with-children-in-this-manner">Who else do you know that engages with children in this manner?</h1>
<p>See #30.</p>
<h1 id="do-you-ever-relate-to-chloe-in-any-other-way-why-or-why-not">Do you ever relate to Chloe in any other way? Why or why not?</h1>
<p>Most of the time I’m just a man who has understood myself to be Chloe’s father for many years. I have purchased a substantial quantity of supervisor reports that demonstrate me relating to Chloe as a parent, teacher, role model, family member, authority figure, protector, and as a friend. I got her to therapy in both Seattle and Tacoma, assured she did her homework before the evening relaxation activities would commence, assured she played in the park with school friends, taught her to swim and ride a bike, rode around town on bikes with her, took her to and from school, organized visits to the zoo, beach, and museums.</p>
<p>During the visit you observed, I would describe interactions as unstructured play, including positive reinforcement and encouragement. I’ve introduced Chloe to rule-based systems like chess, pool, golf, math, and bowling. I spend a lot of time exposing her to math and the sciences, where there are known answers to discover, encouraging her to learn and think, and positively reinforcing effort.</p>
<p>When I instruct her to relinquish her golf putter rather than wielding it like a weapon, or set boundaries about climbing on things in a fun-plex, or choose food that won’t make her flip her lid, I’m being an authority figure. It’s likely Chloe will have a rocky relationship with authority based on her personality and history. Knowing this, I maintain both the emotionally empathetic relationship and the authority relationship, while maintaining the “teacher” relationship so she has healthy things to focus on and learn about, almost as a distraction to her rage.</p>
<p>Emily spoke many times about the pre-conditions for Chloe to seek and earn a post-secondary education. My Dad related an early conversation several years ago in which Emily asked, “Herb, why do some people go to college and some never consider it?” He and Emily subsequently spent many hours talking of such growth.</p>
<p>My relationship with Chloe focuses heavily on learning.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I subscribed to Ranger Rick for Chloe, a magazine she loves, where animals are discussed and studied in detail.</p></li>
<li><p>During a visit on October 24<sup>th</sup>, Chloe said, “I do multiplication. Do I learn it in 2<sup>nd</sup> grade? No! I learn it from <em>this guy!”</em> She pointed at me.</p></li>
<li><p>In March Chloe prepared a certification that now hangs on my wall from the <em>John Dempsey school of Science, Multiplication, Division, and Times.</em></p></li>
<li><p>I take Chloe to the zoo and beach and actively explore with her.</p></li>
<li><p>I taught Chloe to play chess when she was 5.</p></li>
<li><p>I took Chloe to the Seattle Science Center twice, and Seattle Center at least 10 times for music festivals, dancing, singing, and other activities.</p></li>
<li><p>Since 2013 I have provided Chloe with a variety of logic games on my tablet computer.</p></li>
<li><p>I try to teach Chloe a new word every time I see her.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I have a Bachelor of Arts degree and career in computer software. The software industry is heavily dominated by men. Women from Asian countries are also represented, which strongly suggests the bias toward males is cultural. This bias appears throughout science and engineering. One of my first promises to Emily made years ago was that I would prepare Chloe to meet her potential in the sciences. I resolved to teach Chloe math from an early age because I know girls will begin falling behind in math due to social pressure when they’re 10 years old. This cultural bias substantially harms both personal and earning potential. Emily was adamant that Chloe be exposed regularly to extracurricular opportunities, especially in the sciences, and specifically, “All of them.” Chloe deserves to continue participating with me in the enthusiastic focus I place on math, exploration, and the sciences.</p>

<h1 id="who-thought-or-currently-thinks-that-they-would-benefit-from-having-custody-of-chloe-financially-what-is-the-current-status-of-that-issue">Who thought or currently thinks that they would benefit from having custody of Chloe financially? What is the current status of that issue?</h1>
<p>I am not aware who might currently believe that they would benefit from having custody of Chloe financially. I have simply had concerns about individuals wanting custody of Chloe for purposes of gaining access to her funds.</p>
<p>Whoever has custody of Chloe Murphy will receive a check from the U.S. Treasury for $892 per month. This is <em>de minimis</em>. More importantly, Emily Murphy (Chloe's mother) had a life insurance policy for which she designated Chloe as beneficiary. The payout on the policy is $400,000. Although Emily had established a testamentary trust for Chloe in her Will, Emily failed to instruct the insurance company to pay the proceeds to the trustee. Under the trust the insurance proceeds would be used on Chloe's behalf until she turns 25. Under the terms of the life insurance policy, the entire $400,000 would be released to Chloe when she turned 18.</p>
<p>In the codicil to her will, Emily designated me as the trustee of the trust, Donna Mairs (Emily's mother) as alternate trustee, and Darin and Mariela Murphy (Emily's father and stepmother) together as second alternate trustees.</p>
<p>Kyle Coker (Chloe's biological father) has had virtually nothing to do with Chloe since she was born. Kyle's interest in Chloe seemed to develop only after it became apparent that Chloe may be the recipient of the life insurance proceeds. In pleadings that he filed with the court, Kyle Coker indicated that he was &quot;swindled&quot; out of Chloe and that he supported the appointment of Darin Murphy as trustee of the trust. At or about the same time, Kyle Coker advised the court that Darin was making arrangements to host him for a visit in Washington State with Chloe. To the best of my knowledge, Kyle Coker and Darin Murphy had never spoken prior to Emily's death.</p>
<p>Eileen Peterson is the court appointed probate guardian ad litem for Chloe. At the time they opened the probate of Emily's estate, my attorney requested that Ms. Peterson be appointed to act in that capacity. Once Eileen Peterson suggested appointing a professional trust manager, I agreed immediately, even though the will specified me as trustee. At that point, Darin Murphy stopped attending hearings in the custody case, and Kyle Coker stopped responding to email and telephone communications.</p>
<p>On November 10, the probate Court appointed Pacific Guardianship Services as trustee, and entered an order directing that the insurance proceeds be paid to the trustee of the trust for Chloe.</p>
<h1 id="how-much-money-will-chloe-inherit-who-is-responsible-for-safe-guarding-that-money-please-give-me-the-name-of-that-individual-the-address-and-phone-number.-is-there-a-court-order-that-outlines-this-individuals-duties-if-so-when-was-it-filed-and-where-is-that-filed-could-you-provide-me-a-copy-of-this-order-if-any">How much money will Chloe inherit? Who is responsible for safe guarding that money? Please give me the name of that individual, the address, and phone number. Is there a court order that outlines this individual’s duties? If so, when was it filed and where is that filed? Could you provide me a copy of this order, if any?</h1>
<p>Chloe will inherit about $408,000, and a monthly payment of $892 from the US Treasury (Social Security). Chris Neil, a professional trust manager with Pacific Guardianship Services, will safeguard these funds. The court order has been prepared but not signed yet.</p>
<h1 id="when-is-the-last-time-that-you-saw-chloe-unsupervised">When is the last time that you saw Chloe unsupervised?</h1>
<p>May 19<sup>th</sup>, 2014, 8:00am, when I stopped car at her school, hugged her, told her I love her, and told her to have a good day learning as an enthusiastic student.</p>
<h1 id="explain-in-your-own-words-the-recent-supervised-visit-that-you-attended-with-chloe-when-the-supervisor-became-very-frustrated-with-you-and-addressed-it-in-the-supervised-visitation-notes.">Explain, in your own words, the recent supervised visit that you attended with Chloe when the supervisor became very frustrated with you and addressed it in the supervised visitation notes.</h1>
<p>I assume that you are referring to the visitation that took place on October 5<sup>th</sup>, at the home of my uncle, Howard Dempsey. A person named Sarah was the supervisor. The visit took place over four hours. My uncle was present during much of the visitation, and witnessed some of the alleged interactions between myself and Sarah. He has a very different account than Sarah’s.</p>
<p>The most serious accusation in the visitation report authored by Sarah is based on events which I remember quite differently. When I asked Sarah &quot;How many 'I Love yous' and 'how many daddy's?'&quot; she had heard, Sarah clearly responded with an affirmative - indicating that she had heard them. In fact she said, “Oh, it’s clear!” I said my status as Chloe's dad is disputed, and Sarah smiled and agreed with me. Sarah never told me to stop doing anything. So I proceeded to explain why I felt Chloe's feelings deserve a more central role in the reporting: Because I am the subject of a smear campaign, because it's been alleged that I have no legitimate relationship with Chloe or Emily. I was not out of control. I have simply been frustrated by the allegations that have been made against me, and the ongoing litigation to destroy my relationship with Chloe. I was trying to understand why statements about Chloe's emotional context are consistently lacking in Sarah's reports.</p>
<p>At some point Sarah told me that she would not discuss details of the case with me, so I moved to safer ground. I asked questions about where she was from, what music she enjoyed, and the like. These were types of comments/questions I had had with other supervisors. I was merely trying to make conversation. I believe most people would receive this subject shift as a clear intent to respect boundaries, but Sarah did not. I laughed to myself because despite my best efforts, I felt alone in the room. Howard Dempsey, retired schoolteacher, overheard the conclusion of the alleged verbal assault and considered my efforts at calm communication to be appropriate, while Sarah's responses were unusual.</p>
<p>My attorney, Alece Cox, sent a letter to Community Family Services in response to that visitation report. Please incorporate that letter as part of my answer to this question.</p>
<h1 id="do-you-believe-that-healthy-boundaries-with-chloe-include-you-sleeping-with-chloe-why-or-why-not-have-you-slept-with-chloe-if-so-when-where-and-why">Do you believe that healthy boundaries with Chloe include you sleeping with Chloe? Why or why not? Have you slept with Chloe? If so, when, where, and why?</h1>
<p>Age 2-4, and once when 5: Typically when visiting, Chloe slept in a smaller bed nearby, a small flip-down mattress, but sometimes I needed that mattress at work. (I frequently work laying down due to back and neck pain.) On Capitol Hill in Seattle I lived in a small studio apartment. When necessary, Chloe slept in my bed, a full-size bed, clothed in night clothes just as I was. This is common family behavior and healthy re-assurance to a young child, especially when sleeping somewhere other than their primary bed. When Emily was present, there was no additional room for Chloe in the main bed, so she slept in the little bed, despite protests. At my present residence, Chloe has her own room and bed.</p>
<h1 id="do-you-believe-that-healthy-boundaries-with-chloe-include-her-being-allowed-to-run-around-naked-as-alleged-when-her-mothers-care-givers-were-present-why-or-why-not">Do you believe that healthy boundaries, with Chloe, include her being allowed to run around naked, as alleged when her mother’s care givers were present? Why or why not?</h1>
<p>I do not allow Chloe to run around naked! I ask her to dress when I see her naked. I prohibit Chloe from running around naked every time I have seen it, and demand she put on clothes. But she liked to occasionally be <em>in her room</em> both partially and fully unclothed. There may have been times when everybody was tied up tending to Emily when the caregivers saw a naked child streaking across the 15th floor apartment room but it was not the rule. Please keep in mind that toward the end of her life Emily needed 24-hour care, most of which was provided by me. I don't mean to suggest that I was unable to care for Chloe at the same time I was caring for Emily, however, toward the end I was very fatigued with overnight duties and very focused on care-giving obligations.</p>
<h1 id="do-you-believe-that-healthy-boundaries-with-chloe-include-you-bathing-with-chloe-why-or-why-not-have-you-bathed-with-chloe-if-so-when-where-and-why">Do you believe that healthy boundaries with Chloe include you bathing with Chloe? Why or why not? Have you bathed with Chloe? If so, when, where and why?</h1>
<p>When she was 2 and 3, Chloe and routinely took baths with Emily and me. It was fun. We would splash, make silly hats out of suds. I had a white bucket that we would fill up and pour on each other’s heads. Chloe liked to hold her breath. We both liked splashing each other as much as we could. When she was 2, she asked Emily and me about the difference between daddy and mommy, and we explained the difference as best we could. It all seemed natural and straightforward, and not erotic whatsoever. Around age 3 I began using a heavy bubble bath that made the water milky white, and at age 4 Chloe took her final bubble bath with me. The locations were at Emily’s apartment, at my house in University District, and once at my house in Capitol Hill. Nothing seemed strange about this behavior. Emily was aware of all of it. It was something Chloe clearly enjoyed for the right reasons. Then at some point Chloe seemed to become more interested in physiology than in suds and splashing, and I decided it was time to end this fun part of her childhood.</p>
<h1 id="do-you-believe-that-healthy-boundaries-with-chloe-include-you-allowing-chloe-to-lie-on-top-of-you-why-or-why-not-have-you-allowed-her-to-lie-on-top-of-you-if-so-when-where-and-why">Do you believe that healthy boundaries with Chloe include you allowing Chloe to lie on top of you? Why or why not? Have you allowed her to lie on top of you? If so, when, where and why?</h1>
<p>When Chloe was younger she would lay on my chest, but she’s too big for that now. Since age 2, Chloe and I engaged in gymnastic play and dance. Emily, Chloe and I enjoyed visiting Festival of Dance Improvisation (SFDI) in Capitol Hill, Seattle each Sunday, where we and other families developed movement awareness and trust in a bright studio with a mirror wall. I have been a member of this dance group for eleven years. Chloe is experienced and accustomed to gymnastic activities and dance with me. When we dance and play gymnastically, there is occasional contact. I think it’s healthy behavior that has nothing to do with erotic experience or expression.</p>
<h1 id="do-you-believe-that-healthy-boundaries-with-chloe-include-you-allowing-chloe-to-sit-on-your-lap-in-light-of-the-cps-allegations-why-or-why-not">Do you believe that healthy boundaries with Chloe include you allowing Chloe to sit on your lap, in light of the CPS allegations? Why or why not?</h1>
<p>The CPS allegations are far-reaching, consistently false or misleading, and are not the allegations of CPS. They are allegations <em>relayed to</em> CPS, which CPS has not substantiated. I deny that I have acted inappropriately toward Chloe in any manner. Chloe and I have a father-daughter relationship. Kids sit on their parents’ laps to discuss important things, feel secure, tell family secrets and a host of other reasons. Chloe views me as her Dad and I believe she is my Daughter. We practiced that for a great many years. It is evident in the various written supervision reports that Chloe wants reassurance from me. Contact is a central component of healthy parent-child relationships. I strongly doubt the perceptions of Andrea Mattsen, and CPS did not substantiate any of Ms. Mattsen’s allegations.</p>
<h1 id="do-you-believe-that-healthy-boundaries-with-chloe-include-her-visiting-with-you-alone-why-or-why-not">Do you believe that healthy boundaries with Chloe include her visiting with you alone? Why or why not?</h1>
<p>I do, with certainty! I have known Chloe since she was not quite two years old, and am the only father she has ever known.</p>
<p>I have now produced 100+ pages of supervised visitation reports, each articulating the sorts of experiences and interactions that happen when Chloe and I are together. I have several years with Chloe alone visiting me in a number of different situations all of which have been problem-free. Many of those were family events in Emily's company, but sometimes Emily just sent me off with Chloe, and we had enormously healthy, memorable experiences together. I have a large family of professionals and each can add much on both boundaries and what both Chloe and I gained from many extended experiences. Healthy boundaries would also include phone contact with Chloe (she loves to talk on the phone), communicating with her via email/text, and visitation at Chloe's school and in her social activities. I have always been there for Chloe. She needs to return to a sense of normalcy. Chloe visiting me only with supervision limits and diminishes the clear value of our healthy father-daughter relationship.</p>
<h1 id="describe-the-interpersonal-physical-and-emotional-abuse-displayed-by-chloes-biological-family.">Describe the interpersonal physical and emotional abuse displayed by Chloe’s biological family.</h1>
<p>I have known Chloe Murphy for several years, and have known her maternal biological family since the mid-1980’s. The following entries summarize concerns that I have that are not covered elsewhere in this document.</p>
<h2 id="abandonments-by-kyle-coker">Abandonments by Kyle Coker</h2>
<p>With the exception of Kyle Coker's total absence from Chloe Murphy's life, I know very little about the paternal side of Chloe's family and for that reason cannot comment on it. Prior to July, 2014, I’m not aware of anyone in Kyle Coker's family showing any interest in Chloe, which I believe amounts to emotional abuse. During July, 2014, Kyle Coker called Chloe on the telephone and said he wanted to meet her. To the best of my knowledge, Kyle Coker has not seen her. This is continued emotional abuse at a critical time in Chloe’s life.</p>
<h2 id="abuse-of-emily-murphy-by-her-parents">Abuse of Emily Murphy by her parents</h2>
<p>I believe that Emily Murphy experienced emotional abuse from her parents, especially regarding their continued resistance to Emily's wish that I raise Chloe. By way of example, in early December, 2013, Emily told them about her plans for me to raise Chloe. On the same day, Emily’s father (Darin Murphy) and mother (Donna Mairs) told her she was not competent to make decisions, and I was not a qualified parent. The evening of these discussions, Emily explained in a Skype call to me how this was upsetting and painful, specifically because as a person with brain cancer she was frightened by the plausible idea that she lacked competency due to tumor activity. Emily was deeply troubled by these attacks, which she characterized as abuse. She was crying. These assertions continued until Emily's death.</p>
<h2 id="abuse-of-chloe-by-donna">Abuse of Chloe by Donna</h2>
<p>I am concerned that Donna Mairs is emotionally abusing Chloe Murphy by interfering with Chloe's relationship with me. By way of example, with the exception of visitations that take place at my mother's home or my uncle's home, Donna has repeatedly rejected all of my requests to have my adult family members share my visitation with Chloe; she won't even let them transport Chloe for visitation. This includes my father, Herb Dempsey, who is a former police officer and educator. Donna even opposed having the court allowed visitations take place in my family's homes. Donna's attempts to block me from having any contact with Chloe, whether it be over the 46 second video that Donna never viewed and/or the false allegations of sexual abuse, are other examples of how Donna may be emotionally abusive to Chloe. Donna has tried to restrict my contact with Chloe. Based on what Chloe said during a visit November 1<sup>st</sup>, I believe Donna is now saying something to the effect of: &quot;You don't want to hurt John by calling him Dad at this difficult time.&quot; Chloe has a father-daughter relationship with me, and has called me &quot;Dad&quot; or &quot;Daddy&quot; for a long time. Controlling a child, especially a bereaved child like Chloe, by means of guilt is inappropriate.</p>
<p>I am also concerned that Donna Mairs has physically abused Chloe. In the September 18<sup>th</sup>visitation report, Chloe said without prompting Donna had hit her hard in the head. Chloe maintained this claim in detail through interviews with both me and Charlotte, the visitation supervisor. During a recent visit, Chloe Murphy could not identify the source of a bruise on her arm. Additionally, Donna specified a willingness to spank Chloe in her declaration to the court. I find this disturbing because Chloe will experience the 5 stages of grief through every level of her development that will manifest as both anger and depression. It’s critical to her mental health that anger from grief not be met with guilt or hostility.</p>
<p>I do not know what category this may fall under, but I am also concerned about Donna Mairs' initial failure to take Chloe to the Mary Bridge and Gilda's Club bereavement sessions. Chloe had been involved in Bridges since early 2013, and we attended Gilda’s Club since early 2014. She was scheduled to attend Camp Sparkle, a therapy intensive of Gilda’s Club, last summer. Donna pulled her out of those programs. It was only after my father, Herb Dempsey, wrote a letter to Child Protective Services about his concerns regarding Chloe's lack of involvement in the programs, that Donna reinstated her in Camp Sparkle.</p>

<h2 id="abuse-of-darin-by-dina-2nd-wife">Abuse of Darin by Dina (2<sup>nd</sup> wife)</h2>
<p>Darin recounted isolation perpetrated by Dina. She separated him from his children, and destroyed photographs that included Donna. Darin’s daughters were aware of his isolation. Dina prevented Darin from attending the wedding of Sarah and Greg.</p>
<h2 id="abuse-of-me">Abuse of me</h2>
<p>Please see my prior answers. Emily Murphy's family has made numerous false allegations about me, trying to completely disrupt my relationship with Chloe Murphy. Intervener documents and motions show a clear pattern of abusive, misleading, and disingenuous statements and behaviors intended to harm my reputation and bully me to abandon the cause before the court.</p>
<h1 id="what-is-the-name-of-the-social-worker-that-asked-you-to-make-arrangements-for-chloe-to-be-with-donna">What is the name of the social worker that asked you to make arrangements for Chloe to be with Donna?</h1>
<p>Mernetha Rogers, MSW</p>
<h1 id="explain-in-your-own-words-how-donna-is-asking-chloe-to-choose-sides.-please-give-me-specific-dates-and-times.">Explain, in your own words, how Donna is asking Chloe to choose sides. Please give me specific dates and times.</h1>
<p>Donna consistently makes poor judgments about what information should be relayed to Chloe about the situation, and acts as if “anything goes” with regard to communications with the child experiencing a custody dispute. I wish Donna would avoid speculative and authoritative statements and instead behave like a party in a case before a court that has not been resolved.</p>
<p>Chloe said around May 16<sup>th</sup>, with enormous anxiety, “I hate being in the middle.” This experience was documented in the previous intake paperwork. Severe anxiety overwhelmed her all evening.</p>
<h2 id="ongoing-persuasion-effort-around-term-dad">Ongoing persuasion effort around term ‘Dad”</h2>
<p>When speaking with Chloe around me, Donna referred to me as dad until 2014. Even into 2014 she maintained this. Around the time the police retrieved Chloe from Donna, Donna stopped calling me Chloe’s dad.</p>
<p>Around March, 2014 on three occasions when Chloe returned from Donna’s, Chloe tried to explain to me why I’m not family, why I’ll never be actual, authentic family. Each time Emily and I discussed the thesis with her, and she would always agree that family is a looser construct than Donna’s understanding of it, once concluding, “We can choose our family!” Emily and I would happily declare that we’re a family and enjoy a family hug.</p>
<p>On June 20<sup>th</sup>, 2014, after one month’s separation, Chloe asked if she could still call me Dad. I said yes, and she appeared to be happy about that.</p>
<p>During a visit at the Pierce County Fair, after a period of time separated from Chloe due to the Ex Parte order, I noticed Chloe was calling me John. I asked her if she wants me to be her dad, and she said enthusiastically that she did. I told her I will be dad if she wants me to, and she appeared to be very happy, again proceeding to use the term when addressing me for the remainder of the visit.</p>
<p>During a visit on or near October 25<sup>th</sup> I noticed she was calling me John again, and I asked her why. She said she “didn’t want it to be weird.” I told her it’s not weird to me, and that I like it. Her face lit up. She instructed me to call her “sweety”. At the next bowling alley visit, she extended this request to include “sweetheart” and “ladybug”. I believe the message given to her was that calling me Dad made ME uncomfortable. This could be consistent with the “we must be thoughtful” manipulation Donna practices. Addressing it directly by saying I like when she called me Dad put her greatly at ease and appeared to make her face light up.</p>
<h2 id="alienation-effort-against-me">Alienation effort against me</h2>
<p>On June 20<sup>th</sup>, 2014, Chloe said, &quot;Grandma says you weren't mom's partner.&quot;</p>
<p>On June 20<sup>th</sup>, 2014, Chloe asked, &quot;Why were you mean to Darin?&quot; Chloe did not see me with Darin Murphy, so she is recounting something second-hand, probably the conflict about control of Emily’s personal property. Her perception is that I was mean to Darin Murphy. This is certainly not her own appraisal, because she could not have witnessed any conversation between Darin and me.</p>
<p>On June 20<sup>th</sup>, 2014, Chloe asked, &quot;Why won't you give back mom's phone?&quot; Chloe explained that someone on Emily's phone had a horse (which I had never heard before, and am not aware of any horse ride previously), and that due to my possession of the phone, she was unable to &quot;ride a horse rather than thinking about mom's death.&quot; I am executor of Emily's estate, with legal obligations that should be clear to the adults involved. Previously Darin Murphy had exerted substantial pressure to gain control of this telephone. I have never received any request for this contact’s information. An adult introduced this explanation to Chloe, abusing her in the conflict while also alienating me from her.</p>
<p>During the visit to the Puyallup Fair on September 10<sup>th</sup>, 2014, Chloe told me, “Grandma says you aren’t really family.” When I asked Chloe what she thinks, she said she was not sure if I am family, but went on to say she wished to reside with me.</p>
<p>During a visit in Downtown Tacoma, on October 9<sup>th</sup>, 2014, Chloe said Donna had claimed I had voluntarily delivered Chloe to Donna because I was unable to care for her for “that week”. I said that was untrue. Chloe became upset and responded, “Grandma is trying to make me not like you! Why? Why is she doing that?” I told Chloe I did not know, and that she needed to ask Donna why. Charlotte observed and participated in the conversation.</p>
<h2 id="deprivation-from-critical-therapy">Deprivation from critical therapy</h2>
<p>On June 20<sup>th</sup>, Chloe said, &quot;I can't go to Gilda's Club. Not even Camp Sparkle!&quot; Only after a successful effort by my father to influence CPS did Chloe attend Camp Sparkle, which she speaks of regularly and fondly. Why has CPS and Donna Mairs separated Chloe from the well-laid plans for this period established by her mother and me, including Grant Elementary for the Expressive Arts, Gilda's Club, Camp Sparkle, and Bridges grief therapy? Chloe is unusually artistic and expressive! But her therapy regime has been gutted.</p>
<h2 id="alienation-effort-against-my-family">Alienation effort against my family</h2>
<p>On June 20<sup>th</sup>, Chloe said, “&quot;Grandma says I can't see you and I can't see anyone in your family, not even Epona!&quot; Donna Mairs also prohibited Howard Dempsey from attending the visit on that day at his own home. On October 1<sup>st</sup>, Chloe explained that Donna prohibits all adult members of my family from attending visits, unless the visit occurs on their own property. Chloe stated that she wished they could attend. I agreed to keep asking Donna to approve any adult member of my family. On about five occasions since, I invited Donna to choose an adult member of my family to attend a visit, or invite Chloe to choose. Donna first chose Epona, a 13 year old. When I explained that Epona was not an adult, Donna prohibited any other family members from attending. Once I failed to explicitly prohibit Epona from being chosen, so Donna chose her again. On November 8<sup>th</sup> Chloe explained that Donna’s strictness is rooted in not wanting Chloe exposed to any “bad influences.” I continue requesting the GAL to overrule this hostile effort to destroy relationships Chloe developed with Emily’s full support over 5 years, which I can substantiate with strong photographic evidence. I also strongly object to the characterization of my family as full of “bad influences,” <strong>especially in conversations with Chloe Murphy</strong>.</p>
<p>My biological family regularly took Chloe to the park, zoo, and mountain, or just played with Chloe while I cared for Emily. I have no reason to believe they are a bad influence on anyone, and Chloe misses them.</p>
<h2 id="efforts-at-resolution">Efforts at resolution</h2>
<p>In May my father strongly suggested to Darin Murphy that a parenting plan should be established, saying templates are available. A parenting plan would include clear language about the inappropriateness of these remarks and behaviors. To date, no discussion of a voluntary parenting plan has occurred.</p>
<h1 id="are-you-the-executor-of-ms.-murphys-estate">Are you the executor of Ms. Murphy’s estate?</h1>
<p>Yes.</p>
<h1 id="did-ms.-murphy-want-to-marry-you-prior-to-her-death-explain-in-detail-why-that-did-not-happen.">Did Ms. Murphy want to marry you prior to her death? Explain in detail why that did not happen.</h1>
<p>This is a very personal matter. Emily did want to marry me. We went back and forth about it. Emily and I discussed the details of a potential legal marriage in November, 2013. I examined the question carefully with my sister Jan Dempsey and my long-time friend Walter Wittel. Both expressed serious concerns that we could not know how Emily would die. We realized she could easily experience a long, slow death at dramatic expense in an intensive care environment. We further realized this could bankrupt us both, in our marital estate. How could I raise Chloe if that happened? So Emily and I compromised: I promised a commitment ceremony, primarily for Chloe’s benefit, where both families would show Chloe the breadth of support she has. This ceremony would include “everything but the legal papers.” However, Darin Murphy accused me of criminal activity including the intent to sexually abuse Chloe. In the same meeting, he expressed disgust that I did not intend to marry Emily.</p>
<p>Understand I made these choices and plans without knowing Chloe has life insurance funds, without understanding the scope of coverage available to Emily from military medical insurance, and without knowing how Emily would die. I strongly considered the fact that she insisted on all methods of artificial life support. I confirmed this wish with her many times. I studied and practiced C.P.R. and made a plan for isolating Chloe safely with neighbors in case Emily had a medical emergency.</p>
<p>Darin asked about marriage more often than Emily did. He asked the day before Thanksgiving, in San Francisco. He asked again around January 5<sup>th</sup>. Emily responded that we would not be marrying, and later expressed to me that his question annoyed her. Finally, during the second adoption meeting, Darin asked a third time about marriage. Joyce Robson asked about a ceremony and I explained that we had intended to have a commitment ceremony, but added that based on Darin’s accusations in that meeting, a ceremony seemed implausible. Our prerequisite for the commitment ceremony was the clear security of Chloe’s future in my care, but the unexpected harassment and sabotage we experienced made this impossible to achieve while Emily was living.</p>
<h1 id="since-donna-choose-a-different-format-to-address-chloes-grief-due-to-the-loss-of-her-mother-by-employing-dr.-johnson-do-you-believe-that-chloe-is-misunderstood-and-her-needs-are-not-being-met-explain-why-or-why-not.">Since Donna choose a different format to address Chloe’s grief due to the loss of her mother, by employing Dr. Johnson, do you believe that Chloe is misunderstood and her needs are not being met? Explain why or why not.</h1>
<p>I believe Chloe needs and deserves more comprehensive and focused grief therapy, as Emily and I established for her.</p>
<p>Recently I taught Chloe “Big Yellow Taxi”, a beautiful song about loss. Not all kids resonate with song as a way to understand complicated emotions. Chloe is incredibly suited to a music and art therapy regime for growth through grief.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Emily applied to enroll her in Grant Elementary for Expressive Arts.</p></li>
<li><p>I brought Chloe to Gilda’s Club for art therapy ever 2 weeks. The director of Gilda’s Club said she was benefiting from the therapy.</p></li>
<li><p>I made sure Chloe never missed Bridges, a program for grieving children <strong><em>and care-givers</em></strong>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Since Emily asked me in March, 2013 to attend the monthly BRIDGES: A Center for Grieving Children program, I have attended nearly all monthly programs with Chloe, and with Emily when possible. On a few occasions even before I resided in Tacoma, I was the sole party to get them to this program. Donna Mairs stopped attending BRIDGES regularly in December, 2013. I have never seen Richard Mairs attend the BRIDGES program. How closely are they attending to Chloe’s needs now and in the future if they already quit attending this critical program?</p>
<p>A fully operational grief therapy program must include therapy and training <em>for the care-givers</em> as well as the child. It is necessary to know and recognize and respond to the 5 stages of grief—denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance—because they will recur throughout Chloe’s life at each successive level of emotional development! During my training to meet Chloe’s needs, I’ve learned that <strong>it is critical the anger caused by grief not be met with hostility or punishment.</strong> Dr. Johnson’s help cannot suffice when it’s only attended by the child. Donna and Richard Mairs began failing to meet Chloe’s emotional needs when they walked away from Bridges grief training and therapy in December, 2013.</p>
<h1 id="do-you-know-if-donna-plans-on-placing-chloe-with-sarah-her-daughter-if-she-obtains-custody-of-chloe-explain-in-detail-why-that-is-a-good-or-bad-idea.">Do you know if Donna plans on placing Chloe with Sarah, her daughter, if she obtains custody of Chloe? Explain in detail why that is a good or bad idea.</h1>
<p>I was not aware of Donna Mairs (Emily’s mother) advocating this idea until you mentioned it. Darin Murphy (Emily’s father) advocated for Sarah Urquhart (Emily’s sister) to adopt Chloe during the second adoption meeting and in a declaration to the court. However, Emily had serious problems with this idea.</p>
<p>Sarah advocates for medical marijuana on her Facebook page. Sarah wished for Emily to try marijuana to treat her brain cancer. While I am open-minded about the medical potential of marijuana in many cases, including pain management, Emily did not think marijuana treatment for brain cancer was based in fact-based science, and said to Joni Irvin, Joyce Robson, and me that Sarah's view made Emily uncomfortable about Sarah's parenting judgment.</p>
<p>Sarah’s Facebook page includes “420” in the URL, a reference to marijuana culture:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/smurquhart420" class="uri">https://www.facebook.com/smurquhart420</a></p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/420_%28cannabis_culture%29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/420_%28cannabis_culture%29</a></p>
<p>30% of her posts and group memberships relate to marijuana as medicine. I heard Sarah describe marijuana as medicine to Kris, her son. The most common topic of her re-posts is marijuana. Sarah is also active with Facebook and Facebook games, which she has described as an addiction.</p>
<p>Sarah’s husband is routinely away in studies. Emily cited this as a serious problem with the three children they have, and was distressed that Sarah talked about having another child, and saved clothes for another child. With Chloe, that would be five children.</p>
<p>Sarah let a child sex offender into her home, and that person harmed Ally. It’s my understanding Sarah was not aware of the offender’s past, and rejected him from the home after the crime or crimes occurred.</p>
<p>When Sarah lived in Tacoma with two children, Emily would visit Sarah’s apartment to help clean it. She said it was filthy, showing absence of even basic habits for maintaining a sanitary home.</p>
<p>Placement of Chloe with Sarah’s family in Pullman would prevent Chloe regular exposure to both most of my family and most of her biological family, who reside around Puget Sound. It would also prevent regular exposure to places like Seattle Science Center, and other extracurricular science and technology exposures Emily and I highly value.</p>
<p>Sarah and Greg Urquhart (Sarah’s husband) are extremely overweight. Sarah’s new diabetic condition has caused some reduction in her weight. Emily explained Greg was released from the Army due to his size. I correctly Ally verbally once when in Tacoma, when she tried telling Chloe that a jelly doughnut was a good breakfast. Greg told her it was, so she believed it was. I told them both, “That kind of ‘breakfast’ will make you crazy, and make you sick!” Emily always thanked me when I insisted Chloe make healthy food choices based on evidence-based information.</p>
<p>One reason why I think placing Chloe with Sarah is a bad idea is because it is apparent that Donna (and possibly Sarah) planned this outcome without being forthright. No one should circumvent the investigation of the G.A.L., whose job it is to determine and fully examine the best options for Chloe.</p>
<h1 id="has-donna-been-physically-abused-in-the-past-if-so-by-whom">Has Donna been physically abused in the past? If so, by whom?</h1>
<p>I have no specific information about physical abuse experienced by Donna Mairs. Emily called Donna a “punching bag” twice in conversations with my father. Most recently, when Donna arrived at the apartment, Emily said to my father, “the punching bag is here.” Perhaps Emily’s meaning was metaphorical.</p>
<p>I believe Donna was emotionally “pushed around” by Darin. I have examples of statements that indicate that Donna often feels depressed, inadequate, self-critical, and guilty. I’ve seen her mentally beat herself up, act as if she must always be busy, show fear of confrontation and conflict, and suffer from feelings of perfectionism. She shows polarized (“black-and-white”) thinking, refuses to consider facts that aren’t congruent with existing beliefs, lacks creativity, spontaneity, fun, and play, and feels shameful about her sexual past.</p>
<p>When Emily was hospitalized around January 25<sup>th</sup>, Donna said to me, “People say your love is better than mine.” Love in my view is always right, and always compatible. People who loved Emily should have been able to cooperate for her. I find it easier to believe that Donna has experienced a fake form of love.</p>
<h1 id="tell-me-all-that-you-know-about-andrea-mattson.-explain-all-of-the-contact-that-you-have-had-with-her.-how-old-is-she-does-she-suffer-from-any-type-of-mental-illness-how-do-i-contact-her">Tell me all that you know about Andrea Mattson. Explain all of the contact that you have had with her. How old is she? Does she suffer from any type of mental illness? How do I contact her?</h1>
<p>This question is over broad, but I will do the best I can. Andrea Laycock Mattson lived in Kansas for 12 years on her horse ranch alone until she developed a blood cancer a few years ago. For many years she published information about the lineage of quarter horses, and published one or two books on the subject. Darin (Emily's father) helped her with a web site on the topic, <a href="http://www.horsesonly.com" class="uri">http://www.horsesonly.com</a>. When she developed cancer, Darin relocated Andrea to his home in Tacoma.</p>
<p>My contact with Andrea Matts was limited to about 10 minutes of conversation in Tacoma the night we left for Mexico, minor conversation during travel, about 10 more minutes of conversation in Mexico, and about 20 minutes of conversation in Tacoma in late 2013. I don’t know her age. I would always ask about her health when I saw Darin. He said consistently that her physical health had improved, but her mental health had deteriorated.</p>
<p>I believe from the web site that her cellular phone number could be 785-617-0708, and her email may be <a href="mailto:hoofnote@gmail.com">hoofnote@gmail.com</a>, though other parties may monitor that email address with and for her.</p>
<h1 id="was-darin-murphy-removed-from-her-care-as-a-child-why-and-when-who-raised-him-give-me-as-many-details-as-possible.">Was Darin Murphy removed from her care as a child? Why and when? Who raised him? Give me as many details as possible.</h1>
<p>I only know what Emily told me: At age 8, after suffering whippings that left permanent scars Emily had seen, Darin was removed from Andrea’s custody. I believe he was adopted and raised by Terrance Murphy, his biological father. My mother, also from Kansas, notes the extreme rarity of removing a child from the mother’s care in that era and state.</p>
<h1 id="please-give-me-examples-of-borderline-verbal-abuse-that-richard-donnas-current-spouse-perpetrates-against-donna.">Please give me examples of borderline verbal abuse that Richard, Donna’s current spouse, perpetrates against Donna.</h1>
<p>You are asking me to give examples of something Emily said. Emily described the tone and conversations between Donna and Richard as “bleak” and “cynical”. When she said that, I asked her what she meant. She relayed the following incident: She needed something from the basement. As a disabled person, she could not navigate the steps to the basement, or maneuver in the junk-lined narrow corridors. She asked Richard if he could get it. He said, “RIGHT NOW?” In her view, he sounded like a teenager, not an adult. He sounded inconvenienced by having to get up from his video game and walk downstairs.</p>
<p>During Jenny’s wedding Richard yelled at Kris to hold the rings and not lose them. I found his tone frightening and mean, especially because Kris is autistic. I put my arm around Kris and asked how he was feeling, and walked him through the job of carrying the rings in a wedding. I believe taking that tone with Kris is abusive.</p>
<h1 id="explain-why-ms.-murphy-did-not-want-chloe-to-be-raised-as-a-mormon.">Explain why Ms. Murphy did not want Chloe to be raised as a Mormon.</h1>
<p>Emily called the chuch “all fake,” said “God’s a bad idea,” and seemed to completely reject theology as practiced by her mother as an illusion or sad joke. Emily knew the structure of the Mormon church to be patriarchal. She also felt that the church was very focused on compliance. She knew that “coloring outside the lines” was not acceptable within the church and its notions of family, and she knew Chloe to have a strong, independent, creative will.</p>
<p>Emily explained how she dealt with family strictness when she was a young adult in a Mormon household. She said the challenge was to appear to be chaste, pious and obedient, while sneaking away to experience sexual and drug-related activity. As a young woman, Emily would make out with boys in Wapato Park, and take LSD in the bushes of Wright Park.</p>
<p>Emily opposed Donna’s abstinence methodology of pregnancy prevention. I believe it’s also the strict policy of the Mormon theology. Emily and I discussed Chloe’s sex education. Emily said, “I don’t even think it’s bad if she has a lot of partners. So long as she respects herself!” Her views were in direct conflict with Mormon views.</p>
<p>Emily left the Mormon church because she wished to date a particular young man, and could not continue attending church while doing so. Emily strongly disagreed with Mormon teaching about gays and lesbians, and strong church opposition to their civil right of marriage. She mentioned gay Marines who were friends to her in the Marine Corps.</p>
<p>In her adult life, despite holding on to some church values and relationships with people who remained in the church, Emily was much more a Marine than a Mormon.</p>
<h1 id="why-did-ms.-murphy-believe-that-all-of-her-parents-relationships-were-fake">Why did Ms. Murphy believe that all of her parents’ relationships were “fake?”</h1>
<p>Emily Murphy said her parents have “fake relationships” during her discussion with Joni Irvin. Emily also called them “fake people” in conversation with my father. Why did she see them this way? I can only share the details she shared with me. One detail she mentioned regularly about Darin and Mariela was their apparent materialism. Between Donna and Richard, Emily noted the caustic negativity and cynicism.</p>
<p>Darin and Donna were married for about two decades. Emily said of Darin that he is “really screwed up,” and that he “won’t let you know how he really feels. He only shows you what he wants you to see.” Emily also objected to the static gender roles Donna and Richard practiced. According to Emily, Richard never helped with housework, leaving Donna overworked. Static gender roles are implicitly fake. Parties face the obligation to embrace the housework/breadwinning and smile.</p>
<h1 id="explain-why-you-stated-that-you-operated-largely-without-ms.-murphys-familys-help-when-you-were-performing-hospice-care-for-ms.-murphy.">Explain why you stated that you operated largely without Ms. Murphy’s family’s help when you were performing Hospice care for Ms. Murphy.</h1>
<p>Hospice is a major medical situation. Some in Emily’s family were not qualified to handle many of the details. As well, I did not trust the intentions of other family members, most especially her father, Darin Murphy.</p>
<p>I welcomed people who came to help. Emily’s friends Bettina, Janette, and Allison came and helped. My biological family offered to help, and I organized them into weekend, day, and evening shifts. Jenny (Emily’s youngest sister) came and helped.</p>
<p>Before hospice began, Darin claimed both his daughter and grand-daughter were being abused. Throughout 2014, he came to that apartment alone only four times, all briefly. Twice he spoke briefly with me, once he served Emily’s unconscious body with court papers, and once he spoke very briefly with Emily. He worked a five-minute walk from the apartment.</p>
<p>Emily’s mother, Donna, showed up on occasion, and helped with some tasks, but I could not rely on her to administer medication. I asked Donna to feed Emily a Jell-o that included an important medication. Donna got side-tracked and failed to complete the feeding. Visits from Donna occasionally left Emily in an agitated state. Once after Donna left, Emily said, “Exhausting!” and appeared very emotionally drained.</p>
<p>Darin and Donna both brought friends to the apartment who later produced declarations in this case. One also called Adult Protective Services. At the time of these visits, I felt protective of Emily, after one unknown visitor (Barbara) began praying in tongues over her, and another (Candace) acted very strangely, treating Emily like an idiot, then badgering her into consenting to a future visit.</p>
<p>Sarah (Emily’s older sister) came with her 2 year old child who peed on the floor wearing no pants or any kind while Sarah played Facebook games. It might be meaningful for her to be present, but that’s not hospice help.</p>
<p>Darin and his wife would arrive without calling ahead, and sneak into the building, bypassing the call box. He often seemed to have an ulterior motive for visiting. He eventually began making accusations. For example, he read the prescription for rectal lorazepam and claimed based on it that I was misusing oral lorazepam. Caregiver Mariah relayed to me that Darin asked her strange questions about medications, appearing to seek confirmation that Emily had been mis-medicated or over-medicated. Mariah explained that I was the sole medication provider, but he did not ask me. Hospice noted that they had high confidence in my administration of all medication. Hospice eventually agreed to call Darin regularly to appease him.</p>
<p>For hospice intake at the apartment Darin showed up in heavy fireman apparel. It’s my understanding he works as a 911 dispatcher. He insisted the apartment was inadequate for hospice care, though the hospice staff assured him it was well-suited. He demeaned me in front of the nurse and social worker for failing to inform him of Emily’s seizure of March 17<sup>th</sup>. Emily still had the ability to call him had she wanted to. He asserted that his legal role as medical power of attorney obligated me to inform him about Emily’s medical care. The social worker explained later that hospice works closely with the care giver unless Emily becomes unable to communicate. Darin said the transfer we were doing from the bed to an in-room commode (or wheelchair) using a secure vertical bedside bar and a gait belt was unsafe. I studied professional training materials to learn this skill, and was assured by hospice staff and certified nursing assistants that my technique was correct and equipment was appropriate.</p>
<p>I already saw Darin become erratic about the apartment we rented, and then sabotage the adoption. These experiences around Emily’s medical care caused me to doubt his motives and judgment further. He seemed unable to cooperate, but insisted at every opportunity that Emily was in danger and should be in his care.</p>
<h1 id="what-in-the-familys-abusive-psychology-that-caused-this">What in the family’s abusive psychology that caused this?</h1>
<p>This is the hardest question of all to answer. Furthermore, I’m not a professional psychologist.</p>
<p>For months as this happened, I wondered why. I did not anticipate in one million years that I’d come to Tacoma and face resistance. I thought more would be better, and we would work together for Emily. Emily also thought that would happen.</p>
<p>Emily said many times she wished she had her parents’ support. Before hospice began, she noted that my own family visited more than hers, even though my family lived further away. I talked about my “team” and Emily was sad, saying she wished she had a team. I wished that, too, and tried to gather one for her. I think Emily’s parents wanted to have more control over her and Chloe, but I still don’t understand why they weren’t there for her.</p>
<h1 id="did-you-talk-ms.-murphy-into-changing-her-will">Did you talk Ms. Murphy into changing her will?</h1>
<p>Absolutely not!</p>
<h1 id="did-you-talk-ms.-murphy-into-taking-guardianship-of-chloe">Did you talk Ms. Murphy into taking guardianship of Chloe?</h1>
<p>Absolutely not.</p>
<p>In fact I resisted her request over a number of years. On November 12<sup>th</sup>, 2013, I began strongly considering her request to do this. On the day before Thanksgiving, 2013, I promised to do what she wanted, the opposite of persuasion</p>
<p>Emily wanted me to raise Chloe since at least 2012, and began asking me to “stay in Chloe’s life” starting in 2009.</p>
<p>In October, 2013, Emily told my half-brother I would raise Chloe, and he said saying so made her happy.</p>
<h1 id="during-the-time-that-ms.-murphy-changed-her-will-please-list-all-of-the-treatment-that-she-was-on-and-all-of-the-names-of-drugs-that-she-was-taking-the-amount-and-who-prescribed-them-to-her.-when-did-ms.-murphy-change-her-will">During the time that Ms. Murphy changed her will, please list all of the treatment that she was on and all of the names of drugs that she was taking, the amount, and who prescribed them to her. When did Ms. Murphy change her will?</h1>
<p>Emily signed her final will on March 6<sup>th</sup>, 2014.</p>
<p>At that time she was taking these medications:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Citalopram (Celexa) for depression, prescribed by the V.A. primary care physician.</p></li>
<li><p>Levetiracetam (Keppra) 1500 mg/daily to prevent seizures, prescribed by a Madigan doctor who specializes in seizure prevention (name available with further research)</p></li>
<li><p>Possibly bevacizumab (Avastin) to treat cancer cells, prescribed by her oncology doctor, Dr. Myslivich.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If she was in chemotherapy treatment (Avastin) at this time it would only manifest as tiredness for a day after the treatment. I do not believe she had received chemotherapy on the day before the will was signed, as she wouldn’t have had adequate energy. I would need Madigan medical records to confirm this. I believe as executor I may have legal authority to get them.</p>
<h1 id="do-you-believe-that-ms.-murphy-was-competent-when-she-changed-her-will-why-or-why-not">Do you believe that Ms. Murphy was competent when she changed her will? Why or why not?</h1>
<p>Yes. I have known Emily for a long time. On the day that Emily signed her will, she was as clear-minded as ever. We arrived early to the attorney’s office so we parked and looked out on the water. Emily told me that she resented the harassment from her father, and told me that she wanted me to have all the tools I would need to keep her father from interfering with her plan for Chloe.</p>
<p>Emily signed her will on the same day the 2<sup>nd</sup> adoption meeting occurred, so lots of people spoke with her and examined her that day. On that particular day, she described the 2<sup>nd</sup> adoption meeting as, “round two”. This is consistent with her description of the 1<sup>st</sup> adoption meeting as “round one”. That’s not just competency. That’s a Marine’s fighting spirit to protect her child through shrewd maneuvers guided by gut instinct.</p>
<p>Emily was as normal on that particular day as ever. Emily was very focused, strong-willed, and clear-minded well into May. Though the aphasia condition sometimes made it look as if she had trouble, Emily was both very conscious and extremely aware. I understand Darin and others have claimed that I talked Emily into changing her will but I did not. Emily made up her own mind. Additionally, please note that no one filed a petition to contest Emily's will nor do I gain financially in any way under Emily's will.</p>
<p>The following people met with Emily the day that she signed her will, so you can also ask them about Emily’s competency:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Brianne Kampbell, attorney, who interviewed her extensively with me absent from the room in an assessment of Emily’s competency before signing. Ms. Kampbell was well-aware of the allegations made by Darin Murphy.</p></li>
<li><p>Joyce Robson, attorney, who said on that day, “I believe you want John to adopt Chloe.”</p></li>
<li><p>Joni Irvin, Pierce County Adoption Coordinator</p></li>
<li><p>Herb Dempsey, Patricia Dempsey, and Jan Dempsey, who dined with Emily after the 2<sup>nd</sup> adoption meeting. Over dinner Emily said something like, “I enjoy being with you guys. It’s no stress.”</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Emily’s own parents disappeared after the meeting, declined to visit her home with Joni Irvin and Joyce Robson, and declined the dine with us.</p>
<h1 id="please-give-a-time-line-of-when-ms.-murphy-and-chloe-lived-with-emilys-parents.">Please give a time line of when Ms. Murphy and Chloe lived with Emily’s parents.</h1>
<p>I believe she moved from her apartment to their house in 2010, and moved out December 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2013, but nailing down the exact month she left her apartment has been tough.</p>
<h1 id="please-give-a-time-line-of-when-ms.-murphy-and-chloe-lived-with-you.">Please give a time line of when Ms. Murphy and Chloe lived with you.</h1>
<p>December 24<sup>th,</sup> 2013, to May 15<sup>th</sup>, 2014 for Emily, May 19<sup>th</sup> for Chloe.</p>
<h1 id="are-you-concerned-that-donna-and-her-spouse-will-not-be-able-to-financially-afford-to-raise-chloe-why-or-why-not">Are you concerned that Donna, and her spouse, will not be able to financially afford to raise Chloe? Why or why not?</h1>
<p>At this point in time, I hope that Donna and Richard Mairs would have the financially ability to raise Chloe. Chloe comes with a trust as well as monthly benefits that assure custody of her is not a financial burden. Additionally, they recently received $100,000 from Emily's USAA life insurance policy. I do, however, questions the Mairs' financial judgment. Around 2010, Donna and Richard financed a major home remodel using credit cards. The remodel was not completed and substantial debt remained at credit card rates. In a meeting in Fall 2013, Darin expressed concerns that benefits earned by Emily’s Marine service intended for Chloe would instead finance Mairs home debt. At the start of 2014, Donna explained that the purchase of Richard’s truck was financed based on overtime pay, which had since disappeared.</p>

What was that person’s name, contact information, etc.?</h1>
<p>Mernetha Rogers, MSW said in her declaration that I was not able to take care of Chloe because I lacked “a clear state of mind and… was very, very overwhelmed.” She was concerned I was “suffering from caregiver collapse and unable to handle stressful situations.” In her declaration, Ms. Rogers specifies these specific concerns:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mr. Dempsey sat on the couch the entire time I was there and looked distraught.</p></li>
<li><p>Mr. Dempsey was tearful and appeared unable to handle the stress.</p></li>
<li><p>Mr. Dempsey said he “was fearful that he might lose it.”</p></li>
<li><p>Mr. Dempsey told me he had not slept or bathed, and his appearance seemed to confirm his statement.</p></li>
<li><p>Mr. Dempsey told me he could not care for Emily and Chloe at the same time.</p></li>
<li><p>Mr. Dempsey said he was concerned about the custody case involving Chloe.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Ms. Rogers is an employee of Franciscan Health Hospice and Palliative Care.</p>

When? Why? Where? Who is the professional that stated this? If so, what did you do to address this?</h1>
<p>No professional has stated this. I think it’s something Darin Murphy (Emily’s father) said once in a declaration. He is not a medical professional. I suffered “caregiver collapse” according to a social worker for hospice.</p>
<p>To address my condition I sought “respite care” for Emily up to five days in a professional care facility. I also discussed Emily’s POLST, especially with the nurse managing the case. Full resuscitation is not a service typically provided in hospice care. I had been studying CPR, but what if Emily had a heart attack while I slept on the floor mattress? Failing to monitor her heart and breathing becomes unethical as risk of failures increase. I discussed these issues with the social worker, and examined a list of full time care facilities where Emily could get the care she needed. However, Darin intervened to relocate Emily to his home, and then displayed a POLST at her bedside that specified DNR. He had signed this form but a physician had not.</p>
<p>A few days after Emily moved, CPS took Chloe from school. Devastated, I relocated to my half-brother’s house. My half-sister spent the night on the floor beside me and both she and my half-brother walked me around the neighborhood. My brother took Emily’s car keys. My father brought protein shakes that assure nutrients. On May 31 I visited the urgent care facility in Seattle and was prescribed clonazepam. I followed up with Dr. Tobias Dang who prescribed Lexapro and referred me to see Paul Vanderzee who engaged in behavioral therapy with me over 3 therapy sessions. I had one session with another therapist, for a total of 4 sessions. I attended adult therapy at Gilda’s Club and also returned to the cancer support group where I began this journey last year at this time. I worked hard to recover, walking, eating right, and talking with friends, family, and therapists.</p>
<h1 id="what-are-the-effects-of-short-term-and-long-term-memory-with-a-person-that-had-brain-cancer-like-ms.-murphys-explain-in-detail-as-it-applied-to-ms.-murphy.">What are the effects of short term and long term memory with a person that had brain cancer like Ms. Murphy’s? Explain in detail as it applied to Ms. Murphy.</h1>
<p>I am not a physician or health care provider, so this question is beyond my expertise. Additionally, I do not quite understand question. I do not believe that short term or long term memory affects a person with brain cancer; it is probably the other way around. Emily Murphy had progressive brain cancer, which affected her memory. It deteriorated over time, to the point where I’d call it moderate. Nevertheless, I do not believe that Emily's judgment was impaired concerning Chloe. Emily told me in 2012 that she wished for me to stay in the role of Chloe’s dad, and never said anything different. She tried throughout 2013 to persuade me to move to Tacoma and raise Chloe, and eventually she succeeded. It was only within the last month of Emily's life that I noticed her opinion shifting occasionally on various things, then shifting back, but she never wavered about Chloe’s future. In July, 2012, she wrote: “Thank you for being Chloe's Dad. I just wanted to express my admiration for you and what you did and will continually do for Chloe. I know it will not end.”</p>
<h1 id="how-does-brain-cancer-and-all-of-the-various-drugs-and-therapies-that-were-employed-affect-ms.-murphys-decision-making-abilities-at-the-time-when-she-changed-her-will-explain-in-detail.">How does brain cancer and all of the various drugs and therapies that were employed, affect Ms. Murphy’s decision making abilities at the time when she changed her will? Explain in detail.</h1>
<p>I am not a physician or health care provider, so this question is beyond my expertise. At the time Emily Murphy changed her will, she was taking an anti-depressant and an anti-seizure medication. Based on my observations neither of those medications impacted her decision-making (except positively). Nor did Emily's brain cancer impact her decision-making. Emily made sound decisions up until the end of my care for her. At the time she signed her will, she managed banking, logistics of walking around the neighborhood (sometimes with assistance), school matters including Chloe’s awards assembly, decision-making about what treatments she wished to receive and how she wished to die. Emily said that dying means losing control, and she did not want any control of her life taken from her. I promised to honor all of her wishes in that conversation and others.</p>
<p>Emily suffered from a condition called aphasia that was induced by the brain tumors. Aphasia is an inability to <em>speak</em>, an inability to <em>find the right words</em>, not an inability to <em>think</em>. This was confirmed to me by Dr. Natalie Dong, who described Emily as clear-minded in early January when we met with her. At the time she changed her will, Emily enjoyed complex television shows featuring court and mystery-oriented plots, and regularly sang with Chloe and me. Prior to entrance in hospice, she began experiencing dizziness, but showed no sign of impaired decision-making. At no time did I believe Emily lacked decision-making abilities, and so I continued respecting all of her decisions. This is also exactly what hospice did. I know you keep asking about her condition when she changed her will, rather than a month prior or a month after, but I am saying she experienced moderate changes in physical well-being which did not impair her decision-making abilities until very near to her death, when she couldn’t really make decisions because of paralysis, but communicated clearly when awake by blinking eyes or squeezing her good hand in mine. Her decisions remained consistent, and I remain committed to honoring them.</p>
<p>Additionally, please note that no one has filed a petition to contest Emily Murphy's will, and the time to do so has elapsed. Thus, Emily's family apparently concurs that she had capacity when she executed the codicil to her will.</p>
<h1 id="are-you-concerned-that-donna-will-not-be-able-to-physically-care-for-chloe-why-or-why-not">Are you concerned that Donna will not be able to physically care for Chloe? Why or why not?</h1>
<p>Yes. Chloe is a very active little girl, and I have concern that the Mairs will not be able to physically care for her. I have a large body of photos showing Chloe engaging with me in outdoor activities, including running, climbing, boating, and hitting a birthday piñata. I have not seen Donna engage in these activities with Chloe, either directly or through photographs.</p>
<p>Donna is severely diabetic, and requires constant insulin through a machine. She is often lethargic, and seems disconnected from conversation. At times Donna also seems emotionally disassociated. Emily said Donna frequently “collapses” due to low blood sugar. Chloe has described “near hospitalization” conditions from blood sugar extremes. Putting Chloe in front of a television qualifies as care in Donna’s home. But this is about a highly intelligent child who is creative and enjoys “coloring outside the lines.” What Donna may be able to do for Chloe physically has very little to do with what Chloe needs intellectually, spiritually, creatively and emotionally. I also do not believe that Donna has anywhere near the energy or enthusiasm I have. If you lower the bar quite a bit, then Donna can “care for” Chloe. What’s best for Chloe?</p>
<p>Similarly, Richard Mairs plays video games and watches home improvement programs a lot on TV. I have only rarely seen Richard leave his recliner, usually for dinner.</p>
<h1 id="why-have-you-refused-to-give-ms.-murphys-personal-items-back-to-her-family">Why have you refused to give Ms. Murphy’s personal items back to her family?</h1>
<p>I’ve only been asked for the cellular telephone. This device is tied closely to my obligation to Emily. The telephone contains access codes imprinted in electronic memory. Any other property I may have could not be worth more than $100, and I haven’t been asked for any of it. In any case, the probate of Emily's estate remains open and all of the assets in the estate belong to Chloe.</p>
<p>I do have two mattresses from Chloe’s room in storage, which I’m happy to provide.</p>
<h1 id="explain-in-detail-your-style-of-discipline-when-it-comes-to-chloe.-do-you-believe-that-your-style-of-discipline-is-effective-where-did-you-learn-this-style-of-discipline">Explain in detail your style of discipline when it comes to Chloe. Do you believe that your style of discipline is effective? Where did you learn this style of discipline?</h1>
<p>Discipline has many meanings, including structure, punishment, and encouragement toward worthwhile goals. I want Chloe to have a normal childhood in which she is expected and empowered to perform to her potential, explore according to her interests, and experience positive reinforcement attuned to her needs. Chloe needs an enlightened form of discipline, which understands her incredible intelligence, creativity, and desire to explore. She also needs a care-giver attuned to her unique needs as a child who has lost her mother. I suppose I understand some of this because I am intelligent, creative, and adventuresome. Being “different” as a child is frustrating and often unfair, regardless of how or why you’re different.</p>
<p>Over the years I’ve employed these techniques of healthy discipline:</p>
<p>Give choices / suggest desirable alternatives, ignore misbehavior, find age-appropriate activities (where most of her impulses are acceptable and encouraged), confidently assert positive authority to gain cooperation, identify emotional nuances (stay attuned to how she feels), listen, respond with honesty, including emotional honesty, while using language she can understand, be loyal (so she understands the unpleasant moments and the fun times are all part of the same relationship in which I show loyalty to her, and she has consistently shown it to me), respect her as an individual with wishes and unique characteristics.</p>
<p>From a very young age, Chloe has appreciated when I explained the rules and boundaries to her. For example, during Darin’s wedding in his home, I explained that lemonade has a lot of sugar in it, so we aren’t bringing any into the living room, because any spill on the carpet would attract ants, a problem in that house. To my surprise, Chloe hugged me, as she often did when I explained <em>why</em> various prohibitions to behavior exist.</p>
<p>When Chloe was younger, I gave her swats. These only occurred when she engaged in behavior that was dangerous, and was already communicated to her to be dangerous.</p>
<p>One technique I used to enforce structure with Chloe was the availability of internet in the house. The internet would turn off for the entire house at 7pm, with her bedtime at 8pm. This enforced order to school nights.</p>
<p>Another discipline technique I used was the removal of internet, using a plug that was visible but out of Chloe’s reach. I explained to Chloe that “the no no game,” a form of obstructionism I believe she learned and continues to learn from Donna Mairs, would result in immediate unplugging of the internet. There was no double-standard at work with this technique, because the plug turned off internet for everyone. Chloe would get dramatic, saying she’s terribly bored, and I would explain there are so many activities she could engage in, from reading to playing ukulele to drawing to playing badminton with me. I strongly believe in active vs. passive amusement, and taught her the difference. I saw a pattern where she would become belligerent when exposed to too much passive amusement, and I took steps to control her exposure to it. I insisted she understand there are many amusements available, even with the internet off, and she couldn’t rationally claim to be deprived or totally without opportunity for amusement. It just required a little intentional effort. Usually she would engage in something eventually and have fun with it for a while. Passive amusement is addictive and should be treated as such.</p>
<p>I don’t know where I learned these things. I have some exposure to educational environments, and remember promising myself as a young person that when I’m an adult I would remember what it’s like to be a child. I believe this translated into a commitment to fairness, openness, listening, and supportiveness toward young people. I allow broad exploration within safe and healthy boundaries, and I strictly prohibit activity outside those boundaries.</p>
<h1 id="why-did-you-keep-the-proposed-adoption-a-secret-from-ms.-murphys-family">Why did you keep the proposed adoption a secret from Ms. Murphy’s family?</h1>
<p>I did not. I advised Darin Murphy (Emily Murphy’s father) of my intent to adopt Chloe in San Francisco in late November, 2013 with Mariela (Darin's wife), Melissa (Emily's sister), and Emily in the room. I repeated my intent to Darin again in early January 2014. Emily informed Donna Mairs (her mother) in early December.</p>
<h1 id="have-you-called-the-police-twice-telling-them-that-donna-is-kidnapping-chloe-please-provide-the-police-reports.">Have you called the police twice telling them that Donna is kidnapping Chloe? Please provide the police reports.</h1>
<p>No, I did not.</p>
<p>To kidnap is to take illegally and by force. This is not a word I’ve used or events I ever believe took place. I called police twice with regard to the custody of Chloe. I made the first call when darkness was approaching and Chloe had not been returned home from school. Donna Mairs (Emily Murphy's mother) had told me she would bring Chloe home right after school, which ended three hours prior. Donna did not answer her cellular or home phone. I called my sister Jan Dempsey to ask what to do. She strongly suggested I call the police. Emily agreed with this course of action. When the police arrived, Emily placed the report. That report is a matter of record. I do not have it now. I have the incident number, but haven’t been able to locate it yet.</p>
<p>The second call to police was to defuse and mediate a conflict occurring in Donna Mairs’ home and yard. I described this incident in the previous intake. After Donna understood Chloe was in my custody, she asked me to call the police back to cancel the call, and I did.</p>
<h1 id="give-me-a-clear-and-detailed-time-line-of-where-chloe-has-lived-since-she-first-met-you-and-how-often-that-you-had-contact-with-her-during-that-time.">Give me a clear and detailed time line of where Chloe has lived since she first met you and how often that you had contact with her during that time.</h1>
<p>For the first six or so months that I dated Emily, Chloe lived with Emily in a small apartment. She relocated to Donna’s home where she lived until December 24<sup>th</sup>, 2013. In late May, 2014, she relocated again to Donna’s home. I refer you to Answer #20 for details about how often I’ve been in contact with Chloe since we met.</p>
<h1 id="have-you-ever-become-aroused-while-playing-with-chloe-why-is-this-one-of-the-allegations-that-has-been-made-against-you-who-made-this-allegation-when-and-where-could-you-address-this-allegation-in-your-own-words">Have you ever become aroused while playing with Chloe? Why is this one of the allegations that has been made against you? Who made this allegation, when and where? Could you address this allegation in your own words?</h1>
<p>No. Chloe and I have a father-daughter relationship. She has never aroused me erotically or in any inappropriate manner.</p>
<p>I believe you are referring to a claim made by Andrea Mattsen (Emily's elderly grandmother) that I inappropriately touched Chloe when we were in Mexico. There was no inappropriate conduct. The only time I spent with both Andrea and Chloe was in Mexico and the evening before leaving for Mexico, so that must be where she claimed to witness the alleged abuse. That was in late December 2012 and January 1<sup>st</sup>, 2013. Andrea Mattsen has spent less than two hours in my presence in her life. Her allegations are simply inaccurate. Well over a year after I last saw Andrea while with Chloe in Mexico, she left a voicemail with Emily claiming that I had been sexually assaulting Chloe “for a long time.” On what basis could she make this claim? Then she said, “we need to get Chloe in a room and tell her it’s OK to talk about it.”</p>
<p>Andrea Mattsen had a distant relationship with Emily and spent no time with us except once when we visited her. On that occasion, without Chloe present, I spoke with Andrea at length about horses and her life. She did not seem to recognize me as anyone in particular. This is consistent with most of my brief interactions with her at family events. She’d throw me a smile and cheerful look. She did not appear to greet me as a person responsible for both a savage sexual assault and an erection during play with a child. If Andrea Mattsen witnessed these things, why didn’t she prepare a declaration in the interveners’ case? Her son, Darin Murphy, explained during Bridges therapy that Andrea was becoming “manic”, making demands about shopping and generally bossing him around. I believe that Darin rejected this pattern of behavior except where it suited his effort to sabotage Chloe’s relationship with me.</p>
<p>Additionally, Chloe has never reported such an event, even though Andrea Mattsen says it involved fighting me off. This allegedly occurred January 1, 2013. But Chloe had stayed overnight on January 1, 2013, with Mariela's family at Mariela’s cousin’s. When I came to Brazil Street that day, I stayed with Mariela’s aunt and spoke with her uncle, parents to the cousin. When Chloe returned from Mariela’s cousin’s house, we immediately jumped in the truck for the airport. It was pouring down rain. Yet allegedly I had time to step outside in the torrent of rain and savagely sexually assault Chloe on January 1<sup>st</sup>, according to Andrea Mattsen.</p>
