<p>Went to &quot;pre-bereavement therapy&quot; I guess you might call it. For the second time. This time was better than last time. Therapists are good at making ya feel special, and getting you to trust them and tell them stuff. I thought of two more manifestations of resilience. Last month we just talked about joy and hope, reasons to carry on, but today I added bravery and flexibility. Bend or break. My whole situation does boil down to bend or break. The therapists said maybe i can join Emily's group, rather than feeling awkward with her parents. But the Apocalypse is Emily's exit followed by strained relations with them which gives me the Double Whammy loss festival. I guess I'll explain that next time. The glorious Double Whammy. The therapist said my situation is complex. She said complex like 5 times about it. I am not suffering like many suffer. I was curiously upbeat, cuz I realized if I'm not feeling sad I don't have to act all sad. Partly I'm not focused on feeling sad because I always knew this day was likely. Think about it: I met Emily after her second surgery... you can look at actuarial tables or you can live your life. So I just accepted. And so in therapy I want to focus on those who live (the child) but the parents see their child (the momma) who is likely to die. Which I agree is a particularly horrible sensation.</p>
