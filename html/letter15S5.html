<p>Remember the park up the alley from my first house? <em>Ally in the alley.</em></p>

<p>Chloe and Emily hide under the covers. I loved having a couch outside like that. So cozy when they weather's cool, just add some sun and feel fine.</p>

<p>We could color on the walls in the two clubhouses. You called the big one &quot;the book club&quot; after that reading character, remember him?</p>
<p>I remember once I told you that house was torn down. It is gone now. You were sad it was gone, with all our memories there. But I moved on to Lion's Gate, where you met Coco and Kirara.</p>

<p>Cynthia was your first friend out of the house. Once her mom invited us in. They lived next to this park, in the alley. Remember that gorilla pushing that frame sideways? You climbed up the back many times. We'd run in that field beyond.</p>
<p>When you and Emily came into my life, and would get me out to the park each Saturday and Sunday, I learned to have fun in parks again. They are great places. We went to many, as you may remember.</p>
<p>Once, when you were 2, we left a park. I rode you incredibly slowly on my bicycle to home. Emily just jogged along with us. I was able to &quot;grab&quot; you with my legs, so it was pretty safe, but at one point you seemed to... go... limp! You had fallen asleep on the bike after a long day at the park.</p>
<p>I sure loved all the parks we've visited, and all the fun we had, even making friends in the neighborhood. That was where you took your first ride down the slide, and first trip across the monkey bars. Em and I loved parks. (We loved coffeehouses with sandwiches and soup and a leather couch the most.) Around the outside of that park were stone pillars along the fence where you could climb. The cement on the pillars had toys and pictures glued in. Something to climb on. We spent so much time in the park.</p>
