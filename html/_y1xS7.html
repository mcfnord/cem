<p>Emily says I don't love her, and she's jealous of the fun I have with Chloe. I'm jealous of the time Emily has had with Chloe. I paid $120 to pick Chloe up at 4am in a taxi, so she could spend New Year's with me. Emily is jealous I'd do that (even though she was invited). I didn't want to be alone. Emily had some other party to go to. Children evoke passion so adults will meet their needs. I guess we can all feel jealous of that love.</p>
<p>Chloe spent the weekend confirming I'm Dad. We bonded a lot this weekend. I showed her this video:</p>
<p>insert the video</p>
<p>This is Kyle, taking Chloe for her first swim. Imagine you were born without your father around, but you met me when you were about to turn 2, and I pushed you in a baby carriage and spent all my time with you. This is a placid video. But I am her dad. I don't want confusion. I've already confirmed he can't even write her a letter, and I can. Some day she'll ask to see this film again. But not yet.</p>
<p>The day after Harry signed my new will, leaving everything to Chloe, Emily said I had no commitment. That's because Emily was mad. I don't mind when she gets mad. But I obviously have commitment.</p>
<h3 id="jan.-3rd-2011">Jan. 3rd, 2011</h3>
<p><strong>best dad she ever had</strong></p>
<p>don't ever let her fear that she might lose me. don't miss a seaside opportunity. make a truce and it's easier again.</p>

<p><strong>Chloe's 3rd bday</strong></p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="http://toop.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/img/bdbdmex.jpg" />

</div>
<p>On her 3rd birthday, in Mexico.</p>
<p>I miss her a lot. But Emily's not coming over anymore. So the pain part is here. She might be around, sure, but c'mon, she's 3. I may as well be in San Francisco. I could take a bus or a train, but I end up on busses and trains all day. She'll be around, but I just miss her all the time. So pile it on to my lifetime record of sadness and longing. It's best to just accept that people rarely get what they want. They want, and they don't get what they want, and they hurt. That's my life. That's normal. It's abnormal to let it destroy you, or to think it's unfair. It's fair. That's life.</p>
<p><strong>ignusfaatus replies:</strong></p>
<p>forget fair. take what you love</p>
<h3 id="jan.-15th-2011">Jan. 15th, 2011</h3>
<p>Emily and Chloe will be here Sunday. I'm cleaning the house. cant we all just get along?</p>
<h3 id="jan.-19th-2011">Jan. 19th, 2011</h3>
<p>Chloe watched <em>Annie</em> with me. She hugged my head 6 times or so while I half-slept through the movie. I will remember these days when life is cold and I am so alone again. Loneliness is as bad for one's longevity as smoking fifteen cigarettes a day. I will die sooner because I am alone. But at least there were days I was not alone at all.</p>
<p>I'm sick. I think the worst is over. It has taken a toll on my sense of balance. Like, I felt lazy, I felt stressed, I felt lost. Because I am sick.</p>
<p>But I ate better today, and worked out, and took some asthma meds. Later I got a pizza, because I like a pizza when I'm sick.</p>
<p>I feel kinda goofed up. I'm hoping the virus passes and things start to seem ok again.</p>
<p>I'm making progress on all the stuff I'm doing.</p>
<p>I feel like a loser these days.</p>
<p><strong>spider88 asked:</strong> I don't know the backstory...why is Chloe not going to stay in your life?</p>
<p><strong>I replied:</strong> she will, it's just harder because her mom and i aren't dating. but we are still spending time together. don't know what to call it. &quot;the last dappling rays of the improvised family unit that brought lil Chloe through toddlerhood.&quot;</p>

<p>I see Chloe once in a while. I tell her we can do anything but watch t.v. and eat sugar. What a time we have. She calls me dad and says she loves me. But she'll grow up in another city. I'll take hundreds of bus rides to see her.</p>

<p>Emily wants to take Chloe on a road trip to California. I am a little sad because I couldn't talk her into letting Chloe ride a train with me. Sad, depressing, and dangerous, but she wants Chloe immobilized in a child seat for 14 hours. I hope she brings a sedative! I look at an outcome like that as a major failure but she clings to it like it's a great idea. So I'm working through my own California plan, which involves a lot less driving, a lot less time, and a lot more great wins for camping. All because I put train, plane, shipping, and cars on the table and mix-match-create.</p>

<p>Here’s Fatima, Darin’s adopted daughter, telling Chloe this photo is beautiful. This is Chloe at my sister Jan’s house for Christmas Eve, where she went every year.</p>
<p>I bet Darin started not liking me right around the Dash Point Park camping trip. That was around 2011 I think. And I suspect Emily was the reason, but Emily’s money became a bigger reason, and then going bonkers became its own reason.</p>

<p>i dreamed Hillary Clinton was Chloe's mom and she and I were at a summer camp golfing.</p>

<p>i might have totalled my car. i blame me. the oil light was coming on, so i checked the oil, but it was fine. well maybe the oil pump was not working or something.</p>
<p>anyway, at least i stopped driving it when it started to smoke. the smoke was white (bad), nasty smell (not antifreeze!).</p>
<p>i need to figure out a &quot;terminal price&quot;. in a way this does not indicate a dying car, because i got my warning--the oil light. i just didn't pay attention / act conservatively which is necessary for a 1983 AUTOMOBILE.</p>
<p>Please forgive me, old chum. If I ditch you because you cost more than $1,000 to fix.</p>
<p>Car maintenance costs me like $1,000 / year. It's always somethin.</p>
<p>But zip cars are seriously under $100/day? Well that's ten uses, less than 1 per month, if it takes all day. Which I guess it wouldn't have to.</p>
<p>Let's price the fix first. Then think about it.</p>
<h3 id="jun.-27th-2011">Jun. 27th, 2011</h3>
<p>Monday will be a pile of unpleasantries, followed by roller skating with Chloe. It's her birthday!</p>
<p>I have to go to Tacoma, find a mechanic, tow my car to their shop, and just wait for a price. If it's too much then car is dead. LONG LIVE CAR.</p>
<p>CARS REQUIRE A LOT.</p>
<p>We're getting ready for 4th camping. Without the car I have to haul stuff to Tacoma by hand. So Harry found a shopping cart, which gets my basket to the bus, and I can drag it on a rope through my one bus transfer. I like fancy tricks like this.</p>
<p>It happens that a good many of my camping dealios are already in Tacoma, because I brought them to the birthday party in the blown up car.</p>
<p>I can't control whether the car lives or dies. I'm gonna accept it either way. I hope I can find the damn title.</p>
<h3 id="jun.-27th-2011-1">Jun. 27th, 2011</h3>
<p>first, my car is totalled. i'm not even gonna ask. it's just dead. goodbye, car.</p>
<p>i'm gonna sell it for $150, or maybe even $200.</p>
<p>i blame me. i ignored the oil light. i'm stupid.</p>
<p>second, allergies.</p>
<p>mine are severe. and this means a lot of crud for me. a lot of crud i can't do. won't do. know better than to do. won't go where there are cats. EVER. won't go where there are dogs. dogs i can survive a little longer than cats. won't go near cigarette smoke. won't risk eating peanuts. won't go where it's dusty, or where there's ammonia in use. and some perfumes can harm me for weeks with a single exposure.</p>
<p>and so what about other people?</p>
<p>i appreciate when people are concerned for me. i appreciate it when they think of me and make good choices. THIS CAN EASILY SLIP INTO REALLY ANNOYING MOMMY TYPE TALK OR WHATEVER. &quot;OH JOHN DON'T DO THAT YOU'LL GET SICK&quot; LIKE I HAVEN'T SPEND 41 YEARS FIGURING OUT WHAT MAKES ME SICK.</p>
<p>and as for women i might date, sadly obviously some love their cats more and so they're out. some smoke and they're out. some are just stupid or pig-headed and they are out. like, some just have to use some cheap detergent, and i should just cope? or &quot;be careful&quot; ? because their connection to the detergent means more than me. or the peanut sauce is so delicious. if it's so delicious, don't go to dinner with me.</p>
<p>basically i take <em>every</em> precaution, and since i have an engineering mind, that means stuff like HEY, NO PEANUT SAUCE AT THE TABLE, NONE IN THE HOUSE, NO PERFUME IN THE HOUSE, NO RISK OF CIGARETTES IN THE PLAN, NO POTENTIAL CAT HAIR EXPOSURE ON MY CLOTHES.</p>
<p>sometimes it distinctly feels like friends want to play roulette with my life. OH, IT'LL BE FINE. Like once I went to this asian buffet where peanuts were in some dishes and i started freaking out very badly when i realized i might be having a deadly reaction and the last face i might see would be this hippy i met from the Y who was saying, &quot;oh, it should be fine.&quot; the sort of certainty one might have substituting margarine for butter, or not using original Honda parts in their repair job, this is the kind of certitude they'll use on my very life.</p>
<p>so... in addition to no smokers or cat owners, i allow no dummies, and no pig-heads.</p>
<p>the pig-heads really hurt because they think something like how i'm a buzzkill or i shouldn't be so serious.</p>
<p>one cat exposure can ruin an entire day or more. i was trapped in one elevator with a severe perfume two months ago and i still have medical effects. i am blessed with the intellect it takes to manage a good life despite these drawbacks. but other people hurt. their attitudes and behaviors hurt. sometimes i felt belittled or ignored in my last relationship due to my limitations, and that hurt a lot. i have no mercy anymore. no cooperation with violence. i am successful because i defend my limits with harsh severity. few things hurt more than being harmed for 24 painful hours, and then being belittled or ignored in my pain, because i'm such a loser baby. and before the harm, to have my needs or concerns (FEARS) disrespected or devalued... nobody who does this will ever be trusted and i question if i could even love them.</p>
<h3 id="jun.-29th-2011">Jun. 29th, 2011</h3>
<p>I did what I needed to do today: I sold my car. $190. They should pick it up tomorrow. I will miss that old, dirty rat.</p>
<p>I love an old car that runs well, but with parts that don't work. Safety matters, everything else doesn't. I love when parts break. Pieces fall off.</p>
<p>I glued nickels to the hood. I made a hatch window out of plexiglass. I tore out the carpet that molded when the window leaked. I drilled a hole to release water accumulating in the spare tire bay.</p>
<p>With cosmetic pieces falling off and pieces improvised, the thing was transforming.</p>
<p>Time for the next phase. I am a poster child for Zipcar. Fate just nudged things along.</p>
<p>I paid $1,000 each year for various serious repairs. I can shovel that much into whatever rental schemes make sense. But it won't feel the same.</p>
<p>I love a house I can drill, nail, gut, and paint. I love a car the same way.</p>
<p>It has new tires. Those alone are worth $190. But so be it. Goodbye my friend. May u deliver pizzas in car heaven.</p>

<p>in my dream i was Mister Blue, a mysterious party to a legendary series of events. i wish i remembered the events. i was all set to publish a record, even being instructed to press the groove pattern down into the vinyl disk when interest in my identity caused me to reconsider. did i want people drawing their own conclusions about what happened and what role i played?</p>
<p>then i was at my mom's house. all the toilets were blocked. i kept calling my friend but got through to someone at a pizzaria who said she didn't know me. i got a ride back to seattle.</p>
<p>this dream is about identity and authenticity but i can't remember the legendary series of events. only after i awoke did i realize i should publish as Mister Blue.</p>
<h2 id="convicted-violent-child-rapist-3-counts">Convicted Violent Child Rapist, 3 Counts</h2>
<p>Sarah exposed her daughter Ally to a sex offender who targets children. This man sexually assaulted Ally. Later, in Donna's home, Ally sexually assaulted Chloe at least twice, in the bath and the attic, according to Emily. I am not aware of any action taken by Donna Mairs to prevent the sexual attacks in her home.</p>
<p>Jenny dated a felon imprisoned for nonconsensual, “violent” sex abuse of a minor or minors. Donna welcomed this man into her home even when Jenny was not present, as a dinner guest. This caused me substantial distress with Chloe in the home.</p>
