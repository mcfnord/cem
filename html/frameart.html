<p>I just love the style. It bridges the moving, living world into moments.</p>

</div>
<p>This one, which Google gave to me, really got me interested in the style. It can be alive, hyper-alive. They put a fuzz on this one I think.</p>

<p>I made this yesterday.</p>

<p>This one from Google also inspired me.</p>

<p>This is a rich result from that day. I use some fades. Fades aren't cheap, but the high compression helps. This particular delivery model is very sensitive to size, and that ends up driving a lot of the decisions.</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>Fades are actually expensive.</p>

<p>It can tell a story. This took a lot of curation from source frames, plus timings. Was not video! Maybe I'm trying to turn it into video. A re-video.</p>

<p>We float with my brother in three frames into leather couch goodness.</p>

<p>It's alive.</p>

</div>
<p>It's alive.</p>
<p>Of course video is great too:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="http://toop.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/img/swingme.gif" />

</div>
<p>With video it's still curating each frame and duration.</p>

</div>
<p>Here I shift frame durations, and probably carve out others, but the original is video. Optimizations can keep the police away also sometimes.</p>

<p>Google gave me this one, Erica barista free base-of-tree tarot pop-up sash swing. You see that tree wiggle.</p>

<p>From video, but optimized. Reminds me of the ellusive spy caught on grainy tape footage.</p>

<p>Blurs in the originals might be helpful here.</p>

<p>Much fewer colors so I can run longer.</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>Black-and-white is a great optimization.</p>

</div>
<p>For this one, on a merry go round, I corrected the camera jitter on the original video using a filter, and then worked with each frame. In a way re-inventing stability on a spin-n-grin! I would prefer to run every video through that stabilizer filter first.</p>
<p>Here's another short clip I sort of salvaged from jitters:</p>

</div>
<p>A story of one part of one day. Later we learned that death was certain now. But first we watched those swans on that pond between the two hospital wings, cozy with blankets.</p>

<p>Proud of this one. Especially because I did not take those photos.</p>
