<h3 id="jul.-27th-2010">Jul. 27th, 2010</h3>
<p>Usually on Friday night, we battle Chloe to sleep (it's not that hard). She sleeps super-heavy on the bean bag by my bed. She'd climb on Mom who was by me and declare &quot;Let's make a burrito!&quot; So adventuresome. &quot;Let's make a burrito!&quot; That's when we are all squished together. Whoever is in the middle is the burrito. &quot;Chloe burrito! Mommy burrito!&quot;</p>

<p>Cynthia is a girl about 12 we've seen at the park over a year of weekends. Today she saw us and brought a chair and parasol, and said it didn't fit her, and she wanted Chloe to have it.</p>
<p>The story isn't that, though. Just as she appeared, Chloe's cousin (age 11?) said to me, &quot;She's B... B... B...&quot; and then seemed to go into fits. I could tell he had tried to say <em>beautiful</em>. He made me promise to keep the secret, that she's b... b... beautiful, and I said yeah, she is. And then he tried to spit some game at the gate of her house but actually could only fall on the ground and not speak. Hmm, awkward.</p>
<p>Then later he tells us he wanted her address, and that he wanted to be her &quot;grown up&quot; friend. We said he should get to know her first. Which is hard if her beauty knocks you down and renders you unable to speak. But life's hard. Young carnal lust and mild autism! What a blend!</p>
<p>(It did make me think he's kind of cool, because he's in to beautiful girls, rather than killing things or punching people in the stomach, like some dumb kids.)</p>
<p>The other cool thing we did this weekend is make a clubhouse in my storage closet. We painted on the walls and there's a bed and everything. can easily fit 3 little people and have room for me to draw on the walls too.</p>
<h3 id="aug.-18th-2010">Aug. 18th, 2010</h3>
<p>Emily and I broke up. It was my choice. I had a long time to think it over. I realized it was not making me happier. Our values are too divergent at times, and we both have strong wills. I know Chloe and Emily are a set. Knowing I can't control what happens, I'm not trying.</p>
<h3 id="aug.-19th-2010">Aug. 19th, 2010</h3>
<p>This will be a weekend without Emily and Chloe. My car can't drive that far right now, the train only runs weekdays, and they aren't coming up. I will keep cleaning up my stuff and building through the night.</p>
<p>I've been meaning to find nice stationary for letters to Chloe. Emily told her biological father that if he wanted to know Chloe, he should start by writing some letters. I've wanted to write letters to her since then.</p>
<p>*Dear Chloe,</p>
<p>Hi! How are you? I hope you're feeling fine. How are your swimming lessons going? Swimming is fun! So is playing at the beach.</p>
<p>I'm so happy we are friends, Chloe! I love reading books to you, and telling you stories. Sparkles the Pink Pony told me to write Hello to you!</p>
<p>I hope we can play together soon. You can climb on me in the hammock! Maybe we will see Cynthia at the park. Whatever we do, I'm sure we will have fun.</p>
<p>John</p>
<p>P.S. Can you read yet? Some day you can write a letter to me!*</p>

<p>what an outgoing person! aren't some kids shy? she's persistently outgoing. three kids a little older than her shunned her from their sand play, even swinging sticks at her, so she hung out with the teen boys, who were running onto skim boards <em>in the surf</em>. so she played in the surf. but then the boys gave her the old <em>hey kid, you gotta go</em> so she went back to the first group, and battled into the social circle. then she said she's an orphan! when we're sitting right there against the log! and the kids took her to her parents and there was a brief crisis until they saw us waving.</p>

<p>AFTER A DAY OF TRAVEL I was knocked out. at home, a discovery: adjoining tiny bedroom grants all degrees of leeway. three can lay in it, or in the big bed. and now my kitchen computer is top rate, also. the house has been vibing from http://www.ustream.tv/burningman mixed in my own tracks, dude. because it's not chopped up into anything, just a constant goo of authentic and outrageous vibe at most any volume. i almost went to Fry's to buy an amplifier but instead I have a weekend family. Chloe, Emily and I went to the dining area for the old people. Mom looked rather perky, after her triple bypass.</p>
<p>Chloe is sleeping in the clubhouse. there's lots of paint on the walls. We painted for 15 minutes in there tonight. I'm kind of retarded for waiting far too long to realize the coolness of the project. I've been AWOL on that one. But 4 days ago I found a lot of carpet, and now I have two hideout areas. And kalamatas, so I'll get one now.</p>
<p>I got a tiny refrigerator. It's packed with great food now. I turned off the cold and just leave it open and graze, it's so great.</p>
<p>I could have worked out this morning, and that's what made this day kind of hell, missing that. But i confirmed a theory: I can get to Tacoma without much weather extremes (cuz of the tunnel, trains, trolley, etc are all rather lovely to ride) in like 90 minutes. Emily picked me up and we visited my mom. She's by a kick-ass Buddhist temple and a mega-church called Champion.</p>
<p>Now I'm eating delicious grapes, called Sweet Yellow Baby Grapes, plus kalamatas raw. My computer returned to whining from the heat, it says. And the load. I also have some salmon, and healla yeah let's eat chocolate: Trader Joe's Dark Chocolate COVERED Powerberries, real fruit juice pieces made with acai, pomegraate, cranberry, and blueberry juices and dipped in smooth dark chocolate. THEY'RE PRETTY GOOD FOR YOU AND OUTRAGEOUSLY TASTY.</p>
<p>Update: A full bag of Powerberries gives me 120% of my USRDA of Saturated Fat! You see? Health!</p>

<p>MY NAME IS JOHN I AM ZEN AS I'VE BEEN ALL WEEK NOW, AFTER THREE KIDS CHASED ME AND I CAUSED A STIR AT THE PLAYGROUND LOTS OF RUNNING WITH CHILDREN CHASING ME, THEN ON MY BICYCLE WITH THEM CHASING, AND THEY WERE LIKE 4 AND 5 SO I COULD SMASH THEM INTO EACH OTHER AND THEY'D FALL ON THE GRASS A LOT. After working a day at work-at-home Friday, I was all hella wound up like a jack. There were five kids on me at one point. I love when this happens to me.</p>
<p>And the evening as usual was hot.</p>

<p><strong>my dad is in the news</strong></p>
<p>*Dempsey is a self-confessed gadfly, a former Bethel language arts teacher who retired in 1992. His retirement hobby is filing Title IX complaints with the federal government.</p>
<p>Over the years, he said, he has filed them against Tacoma, Bethel, Olympia, North Thurston, Peninsula, Puyallup, Sumner, University Place and other districts around the state. Heâ€™s filed multiple complaints against some, including Tacoma.*</p>
<p><strong>Emily replies:</strong></p>
<p>You go dad! Stupid Tacoma!</p>
<h3 id="nov.-7th-2010">Nov. 7th, 2010</h3>
<p>Tomorrow is Emily's birthday. She was my girlfriend, but we've been on the ropes. We're on the ropes because I can't see marrying her, and things can't just stay the way they are. We still meet up and have fun together, but there's more gloom to it. And her daughter Chloe makes me very happy. But now it's not so clear how or why Chloe will spend time with me, save when I visit Tacoma, where she lives. Her house is dusty so I can't spend time there. It's a recipe for more sadness and cynicism. Out of work, living through each week, it gets so quiet here, and I miss her. I've seen them both every weekend for at least 18 months. Each weekend now seems like it could be the last.</p>
<p>I always told myself Emily and Chloe are gifts of fate. When you meet someone and plan a family, one could call that the classical model, but this was not like that. And so the mismatched details didn't matter. Details don't matter with fate. You can't choose your fate, so screw the details, right?</p>
<p>If or when I find someone new, Emily will feel hurt. And maybe she won't have any inclination to keep Chloe and me together. So I get to lose. If the gain was fate, the loss is, too. I can't pick and choose. And as for dating, or meeting anyone, I'm dreadful at it, and anyway after all we live in Software Engineerville, aka successful dude central. So I will be alone again.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, I accept this much without feeling cynical. I'll go on a date or two with someone, but odds are they won't suit me. Emily will feel hurt and not wish to bring Chloe, and I won't be able to visit, certainly not the way they both visit me here, because I'm asthmatic, and so I'll be alone and lose them both, and no one will replace them.</p>
<p>Which is why I figure I may as well move to San Francisco. I'm looking for a place to live March through May when allergies destroy me here. I don't know if this is the year or SF is the city. I know I'm lazy and I know this plan sounds like work. Staying and getting sick alone is probably what will happen again. Strangely it only makes me a little sad. Like I said it's fate and fate has as many ups as downs, right? Ups and downs are a package deal.</p>
<p><strong>Emily responds:</strong></p>
<p><strong>tearing me apart</strong><br />
exercise, you'll feel better.<br />
love,<br />

<p>I've always believed in the power of joy in the face of oppression.</p>
<p>So does Ai Weiwei. He's a modern artist. The Chinese government doesn't like him. So they've declared his art studio illegal. So he decided to throw a demolition party.</p>
<p>&quot;Many had been warned by local police not to come, but they still made the effort and enjoyed music and wine and crabs.&quot;</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="http://toop.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/img/tablewei.jpg" />

</div>
<p>Ai Weiwei knows how to topple tyrants:</p>
<p>&quot;As for what happens to the complex, I have been quite firm that I will not donate it or sell it, since the government has decided it is illegal. The government actually wants to buy it from me, but I have invested eight million yuan and the government has not explained to me why I am allowed to sell it to them if it is illegal. The complex is a good piece of art. Actually my friend has offered me his land to build an identical complex once this one is torn down.&quot;</p>

<p>Emily told Chloe I'm her dad, practically speaking, which is something Chloe already felt or wished. I never said I'm her dad, but I never denied it when she said so. (Except once, which was just the first time, when she was very young, she started raving at me about how I left her. Well I didn't do that. And I didn't know what would happen, and I didn't want her to be totally confused. So that time I told her I'm John, and not her dad.) Emily told Chloe all this because Emily isn't coming over anymore. Which means I'm now an unofficial official dad. Chloe sounded unusually serious, and said something about &quot;I didn't know how I got here, but you're my dad and you showed me. I love you, Dad.&quot; Of course I wish Emily wouldn't run Chloe through these revelations at 11:45pm, when Emily herself is probably emotional about deciding to stop coming to see me, but whatever. Emily made Chloe without my help, and I think everyone figures everyone is better off with what we all have.</p>
<p><strong>Emily replies:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Correction</strong></p>
<p>Daddy, not father.</p>
<p>A father is legally and biologically yours forever and ever. A daddy is a person that loves and acts like a father should. McFnord is a great daddy. He loves my daughter very much. Almost immedietly I sensed that bond.</p>

<p><strong>Chloe wrote back to me</strong></p>
<p>Dear John,</p>
<p>If you see a monster, take a sword and kill it. How are the ponies? They are at my house eating some hay. If you see another monster, kill it with a sword. I love you John. If you see a penguin take it on a leash and scramble him. Put him in the ocean. If you see a lion take him on a leash so he doesn't go in your home. Don't run in your home. If you see another monster, kill it with a sword too! And so leave a message to John and then if you see a monster kill the monster.<br />
love,<br />
Chloe<br />
P.S. If you see a monster. kill it with a sword.<br />

<p>I left Emily in her car with Chloe after we dined at the Gateway to India. We wondered what it would be like to have a gateway to anywhere. Where would you go? I said strife or genocide, though I'm not equipped to handle it emotionally. I'm pretty neurotic about harm.</p>
