<p>Em said she wanted to be a flapper, which is a fancy-dressed dancer from the 1920's. We found this costume in a costume shop in Seattle, on Broadway. See the frills along the skirt? And the feather in the silver head band. I was dressed as Heck Yeah Man. (That word, <em>heck</em>, doesn't bother me! Words in general don't really bother me. Some ideas do, but not words.) And you were the classic fairy princess!</p>
<p>Behind us is my step-mom Pat, and my dad, Herb. I see Epona and her friend at the top. Jason has the copper mask behind me, and on the right it's Roberta and Hathan with little Mathias. He likes trains A LOT.</p>
