<p><em>When Chloe was 5, I wrote a short vignette of Mariela being Chloe's mom. Chloe took great interest in what I wrote, and sounded surprised and deeply touched that so many words had been written for her. &quot;I'm so happy you wrote all this for me!&quot; It was probably 50 words. The next night she asked to read it to us by candle light.</em> </p>

<p>I kinda should hustle this summer. If I do an Android app, I'll have other options, though it might mean San Francisco. So be it. The money is there. I would hate to leave Chloe though, just as mom dies. Can't do it. I know I can't do it because I can tell she loves me so much, and I am so important to her at this time. But if I do that self-study, I'll be more employable here.</p>
<p><strong>Walter Wittel responds:</strong></p>
<p>Sad about Chloe's mom (hadn't heard, I knew she had health issues). Responsibility, what life is about. Plenty of Android activity in Seattle</p>

<p>For Father's Day I gave Chloe the longest hug in the world, maybe 5 minutes, because she wouldn't let go. It's clear the problems are taking a toll on her. We won't let her fall apart.﻿</p>

<p>I keep thinking about what I love. Singing? So I sing and ride. Chloe? So I think of her. I got Chloe a remote control UFO. Very simple up down with blinky lights. I had one that blew my mind so hard one evening that I immediately smashed it up on the street by accident, just so juiced to boost a UFO. I also got other gifts for her birthday on Thursday, age: 6.﻿</p>

<p>Chloe is on Skype typing messages to me because she can see and hear me, but I can only see her. First grade!﻿</p>

<p>Went to &quot;pre-bereavement therapy&quot; I guess you might call it. For the second time. This time was better than last time. Therapists are good at making ya feel special, and getting you to trust them and tell them stuff. I thought of two more manifestations of resilience. Last month we just talked about joy and hope, reasons to carry on, but today I added bravery and flexibility. Bend or break. My whole situation does boil down to bend or break. The therapists said maybe i can join Emily's group, rather than feeling awkward with her parents. But the Apocalypse is Emily's exit followed by strained relations with them which gives me the Double Whammy loss festival. I guess I'll explain that next time. The glorious Double Whammy. The therapist said my situation is complex. She said complex like 5 times about it. I am not suffering like many suffer. I was curiously upbeat, cuz I realized if I'm not feeling sad I don't have to act all sad. Partly I'm not focused on feeling sad because I always knew this day was likely. Think about it: I met Emily after her second surgery... you can look at actuarial tables or you can live your life. So I just accepted. And so in therapy I want to focus on those who live (the child) but the parents see their child (the momma) who is likely to die. Which I agree is a particularly horrible sensation.</p>
</div>
<p>I have made it this far being recklessly resilient. Hell, December crazy grandma pegged me for a child fucker of some kind, and nobody told me, but everyone was freaked out and I didn't know why. That's how the year started. To be where I am now is remarkable. I will articulate that even if my future in Chloe's life is nothing like my past, it will be worth it, the world burns, people go crazy, people die, people get separated, it's not my choice. Chloe's outrageous attachment to me has made it all ok. I know the world blows things up all the time, and children get locked in basements instead of freed, cuz the world's cold, cuz life's hard, cuz misery loves company. I can't control when Chloe becomes someone else's child. Emily designated her parents and her parents will designate whatever they want. If that destroys a huge part of my life, I'll be like the Joker walking away as the building explodes. I guess I can write letters. And all this is contrived worst-case thinking. Still, fuck this child fucker shit, still hanging over me long after everyone else forgot, plus fuck anyone who doesn't jump in and interact with a child, just clucking the rights and the wrongs. When I explain things to Chloe, she has always showed the greatest appreciation. She hears Rights and Wrongs all day long but how often are things explained?</p>
<p>Well everything's secret there so I can't tell you more. It's just a group of volunteers who lived through loss and people doing so now. I figure fuck it, everyone's still alive, let's go have some fun. And if ya die, at least we had some fun. Don't overthink death around those who still live.﻿</p>
<p><strong>Walter Wittel responds:</strong></p>
<p>Difficult situation. Wish I could say something that would make it all (mostly?) go away. Glad you are getting some professional help where they at least have experience with similar situations.</p>
<p>But I'm sure you will pull through. If there is something I can do to help please let me know.</p>

<p>Chloe leaves me phone messages. She registers complaints about bedtime--going to bed when it's still LIGHT out???--and yesterday she called to tell me it's October 14th.﻿</p>
<h3 id="oct-18-2013">Oct 18, 2013</h3>
<p>The house is nearly spotless and there's food in the fridge.</p>
<p>This grief counseling has pushed me into a complicated spot. I want to avoid or minimize future grief, unnecessary and avoidable grief, for me and for Chloe. So I have studied Emily's will. I have concerns, but little leverage. So maybe I get my soul crushed. Don't tell me that's God's will. But I'm prepared. As prepared as I can be. I'm making progress on something I value intrinsically. Chloe is the sole beneficiary in my will, for her education.</p>
<p>I think I need to &quot;step up&quot; my emotional stability. Emily's pushing for a ring, but it can't be. I have to figure out the most attainable plan that offers Chloe the most opportunity. If I'm clouding Emily's thinking, I need to resolve that. It's mostly about opportunities for Chloe. But I have to live with her will, while she doesn't. You think about that for a while.</p>
<p>The shitstorm only looms. It's a great time to stay stable.</p>
<p>And I won't show my junk on Skype anymore because of what her will says. I guess shit's fucking bonkers. I feel ok. She is mad. She wants sex. A sex show. But her mother is my future. What does her mother want? She is happy I love Chloe, but wishes I loved her as much. I live her will now.</p>
<p>Her father's attorney told me families go crazy when people die. I have arrived. Tomorrow I care for Chloe while Emily's brain gets an MRI. To confirm. Something I have known. Throughout my affair. Has come.﻿</p>
<p><strong>Walter Wittel responds:</strong></p>
<p>Stay stable. You will help some way (maybe unknown now).</p>
<h3 id="oct-20-2013">Oct 20, 2013</h3>
<p>Today I got Emily to say YOLO. It took some coaxing because she is terminally ill. But it made her laugh.﻿</p>
<h3 id="oct-27-2013">Oct 27, 2013</h3>
<p>I am doing some Shit From Hell. I guess it's a custody negotiation. The attorney told me years ago that families go crazy when people die. If that's right then I'm ahead of the game. This weekend went very well. I went from shitty situation a month ago to terror a week ago to near victory now. At the center is a woman who is coping with her coming death, and now also coping with strong disagreement between her parents (and me) about what's best for her child. I am fortunate that I was able to express my feelings, concerns, and wishes in a way that did not distress her. No solution will make all the adults happy. At the moment, one is in agony. But what will help the child most? That question has been my focus for 1 month. I think strangely that it all started when the child (age 6) said to me on the playground: &quot;YOU WILL BOW DOWN.&quot; Those were her first words when we got to the playground. I shouted back louder, &quot;<em>YOU</em> will bow down!&quot; Then I played a chase game similar to what we've done since she was a toddler. I am secular and some people in her life are religious. The dark arts of submission and shame meet my wizard spells of play therapy and unconditional positive regard. Who will bow down? Not me.﻿</p>
<p><strong>Walter Wittel responds:</strong></p>
<p>Regardless of outcome good for the three of you that you care. It will be important over time.</p>
