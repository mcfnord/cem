<h1 id="mexico-genesis">Mexico Genesis</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Invitation: I hadn’t been in close contact with Darin in 2009, but I must have written about something, and he invited me to Melissa’s wedding. At that wedding I saw Emily, and saw Emily’s tattoo (which said CHLOE), but did not meet Chloe. (She was napping.) Darin invited me to come to Puerto Vallarta and stay with him.</p></li>
<li><p>Darin insists on two things in Mexico: He doesn’t wear a watch, and he doesn’t wear underwear.</p></li>
<li><p>Darin discussed the availability of hit men in Mexico, where he owned a time-share condo in the more-American part of town, north of Puerto Vallarta. (Nuevo Vallarta.) He called his condo and someone answered, which was unexpected. Darin believed his wife to be ruthless and greedy, and he believed his status as her spouse might incentivize her to have him killed so she would receive both assets and fire department pension. Some member or members of Mariela’s family reportedly asked if he needed to have someone “taken care of” and he declined this offer. Darin explained that Mexico is a place where people just “disappear”. He said Dina had stolen at least $100,000.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>April 10:</strong> Darin found a bicycle I could ride, but the tube exploded. Darin took me, Melissa, and Rob to the beach in Puerto Vallarta. People stopped at various shops.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>April 13:</strong> Darin thanked Mario for allowing Darin to date Mariela, and stay in the house. Darin snuck Emily, Chloe, and me into a tourist resort water park, because Darin knows the guy at the counter. Later Darin jumped into my bed to cut off my wristband, so someone else could wear it to get into the water park. Darin and Jenny were in a very minor car accident.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>April 14:</strong> Darin drives Emily, Chloe, Jenny, and me with Mexican family to a small, local resort: A grill, a pool, a zipline overhead (we didn’t go on it). I swam with Chloe in the pool. Everyone asked how old she was (in Spanish).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>April 20:</strong> I start falling for Emily. She has terrible allergies.</p></li>
<li><p>Trip Details: During that trip, I stayed in Darin’s duplex home, along with Melissa and Rob (on their honeymoon). Then Emily and Chloe arrived, and Melissa and Rob went somewhere else. Then Jenny arrived, and Darin’s dad Terry came with Terry’s wife. I told Emily I had a cozier bed than the one she was in, but she only checked it out on the second night. Darin got us some marijuana and we had a wildly memorable time, walking to the taco shop for fresh squeezed juice.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>May 2<sup>nd</sup></strong>: Darin drove Emily, Chloe, me, and Mexican family to a family baptism, three hours. One boy had a birthday, too, and sang 3 traditional Mexican songs karaoke style. Then a woman entertainer sang ten songs.</p></li>
<li><p>I spent evenings cobbling my experiences into narratives with photos, including photos taken on Darin’s camera and my own. These photo essays are still available.</p></li>

<h3 id="movie-star">Movie Star</h3>
<p>Darin projected <em>Night of the Iguana</em> on the wall at Mariela’s house. Her father Mario is a carpenter. He built the whole 3 story cement home, with business, workshop, and cool penthouse. It turns out Mario is in this movie from 1963, when Puerto Vallarta was a fishing and farming town. He was an iguana pitch kid then, holding the iguana above his head so people would stop and pay to see the iguana. We watched his brief cameo many times. He said the movie made the city famous, and then in 1969 the international airport made it into a tourist destination.</p>
<h3 id="drug-dealer-neighbor">Drug Dealer Neighbor</h3>
<p>Mariela got some joints from her neighbor friend. Later he would be murdered in prison, and his family suspected Mario’s family, until someone became a godfather, and Darin set up running water for the family who lost their son.</p>

<p>This was a few days before Emily arrived. The backstreets of the city are dusty, and we had to cover up. While gunning through the dusty roads, I saw chickens, horses, dogs, cinderblock shacks, and of course Mexicans! Some of them pushed ice cream carts. My 4-wheeler did not have functioning brakes. Fun! At the top of the hillside we all stopped for snacks and looked out over the city.</p>

<p>Some in my family were offended when I was omitted from Emily’s obituary. But who took the picture of Emily in the obituary? I did.</p>

<p>Mario and Soledad are Mariela’s parents. They never were officially married, until April 18<sup>th</sup>, 2009. I believe this is the day Darin spanked Chloe, age 22 months. I took these pictures of their wedding, using Darin’s camera. The ceremony was May 2<sup>nd</sup> while the official wedding was April 18<sup>th</sup>. I took these photos, aren’t they nice?</p>

<h3 id="apr.-17th-2009">Apr. 17th, 2009</h3>
<p>We all played (sing, dance, clay, climb) with little Chloe until her bed time came and then Jenny made margaritas and Emily and Jenny wanted to watch girls making out on the internet, so we did, and then I showed them my favorite videos, and pictures.</p>
<h3 id="apr.-19th-2009">Apr. 19th, 2009</h3>
<p>Today I took Emily, Jenny, and Chloe for tacos. Then, since it's Sunday, and it's also the day after their wedding, it's necessary for Mario and Soledad to party all day in the street. Which means 10 kids and 10 adults on the sidewalk with an enormous amplifier playing dance tunes, two cool boys playing DJ and taking it seriously. There's Coronitas (Corona beer in tiny bottles), curried chicken, and cake. The kids all got little toys today, like a firetruck for the boys, lip gloss for the girls. I think we're going to the carnival later, with bumper cars and such. Carnivals, circuses, and clowns are huge deals here.</p>
<p>I spent some quality time with Chloe, who is almost 2. I convinced her that I don't accept squirming or bossing around, and apparently she believed me today. Funny to watch her realize she's not gonna get away with the same old games. It helps that she's tired. Together we explored the house and danced with the chicas on the sidewalk. I was happy to re-capture the same sort of pleasant grownup-child vibe I used to have. We bonded. It requires knowing my power is strong, sincere, just, and clear, and then just Offering The Groovy, and being comfortable at her speed and in her vibe. Once you get into the kid's vibe, the rest is easy. I am happy I am not the daddy with actual binding responsibilities here, because her Terrible Twos have begun. But I think I could handle a year of war with a 2-year-old, without turning into a cranky tyrant. So long as I had some help. That's where Mexico far outperforms America. The whole block is friends, or related. The kids are always under someone's eye and care. In America, we've screwed up, going independent and individual to a fault.</p>
<p>Chloe is a fanatic for dancing. As are these Mexicans.</p>
<p>The girls (four 9-year-olds) love Chloe. They dote on her and take her all around the block. They prevent her from running into the street. I figure she's as safe as a Mexican child. Which is not that safe but so be it. It takes hundreds of rides in a pickup flatbed before you actually fall out, probably, on average.</p>

<h3 id="apr.-20th-2009">Apr. 20th, 2009</h3>
<p>With Emily and Jenny, showed them funny YouTubes, and we talked for hours.</p>
<p>Emily and Chloe and I ran around throwing my hat. Chloe didn't really have that much fun... she is so kinda wiggy, running away. And I didn't feel so real as anyone's closest friend, awkward and hot. But I used many words, and played many games with the girl, and it was the best fun I had in years, which says much about the years. I tried to teach her what shade is, and what sun is, and how it's cool in the shade.</p>
<p>I told Emily I'm attracted to her. And her daughter is also fun, not even two, all shrieking and barely knowing words. she adores me now, as i heard the birds with her, saw the flowers, played with her without stop for an hour, let her pet the porcelain dog.</p>
<p>I aced the interview. Then I hugged Emily, and she cheered sweetly for me, and we played with Chloe. And it was the greatest hour of my recent life, playing with Chloe, even though she takes a lot of focused energy. I've seen a lot of stuff, but I haven't seen a little baby in a while. She learns every word and I am the writer with the words. I don't want to feel awkward around Emily by making a bad move, because I am not over Akiko, and that's obvious. I think of being with Akiko's child and I forget about Chloe. Which means I'm trapped. But the thought passes, and I just feel sadder than normal for a moment, that she is not mine.</p>
<p>I hear birds sing, see flowers, make a picnic of a pack of cheese, and I'll do it with my family. But I hardly know Emily, and don't want to freak her out. Like her father, I'm reserved, cautious, and nervous. In the sun I touched her tattoo for five minutes, of Chloe's name around a shamrock. I told her I'm attracted to her. Last night in the haunted house I wanted to turn on her in the dark and say, &quot;Oh, God, those aren't my hands!&quot; but I'm a big safety wimp in the dark so i just led her by her fingertips, screaming through the haunted house. I really get shy and nervous sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> We walked to the tacoria, hopping between shades of trees on a quiet family street. At the tacoria, the man and I haggled and we ate. I tipped him very well ($100 pesos on about a $80 peso meal, plus a $5 US) and he called me his friend. I could tell my meager Spanish was appreciated. So was his taste in music, and his comfortable corner open air location, an oasis near my home. The drinks he offered me were Insane Sugarbombs, and I gracefully declined. He also pitched some sugar for the baby, but I dodged. And he pitched some beans and chips, but I dodged that, too. I raved about the music because he's got great tracks playing. Covers of famous 80's tunes in lounge? Greensleaves? The guy is on for any dude.</p>
<p>After we came home, I played with Chloe for an hour until she fell asleep. Emily laid on my arm a while and that was sweet.</p>
<p>Chloe is so rebellious. Her pressure to run free is constant. She wants to run free and shriek like a banshee, and it's just not possible, so we kinda battle her will a lot, and it's only because I'm highly amused with the job that I keep it up an hour if necessary, until she chills out and can relax in the hot Mexico sun. I'm really sensitive to temperature myself so I know how to stay cool... she sorta gets it, hot sun, shade, sun hat, but not quite yet.</p>
<p>Emily was a career marine (8 years) until she got ill. Now she's recovering and going to school. She's really pretty, with raven eyes and hair.</p>
<h3 id="apr.-21st-2009">Apr. 21st, 2009</h3>
<p>Chloe, Emily and I went to the park, where we rode on the swing, and the teeter-totter. Then we bought delicious chicken tacos, fresh-squeezed orange juice, and cheesecake. Chloe locked herself in the bedroom and fell asleep, but we found a way in before she woke up.</p>
<p>I made a slide show with adorable cats that Chloe seeks out, watches, and calms down and says, &quot;Oh, cute!&quot; We call it &quot;Chloe crack&quot;.</p>

<h3 id="apr.-22nd-2009">Apr. 22nd, 2009</h3>
<p>Today we didn't really leave the house, except for tacos and juice. I played on the swing with Chloe while Emily bought milk and cheese. Chloe had a pretty successful day, much more comfortable here at her new home, taking two naps without much trouble, even going to bed with ease. We enjoyed some ball kicking, some balloons, watching the monkeys and kitties on the computer, dancing to some music, and even some skat/singing/&quot;word jazz&quot; where the words aren't quite cogent English. She usually let me pick her up, because she has come to dig me and my whole scene of groovy discovery fun, and sometimes she climbed right up to me. Food also went smoothly, with munches on apple slices, hot quesadillas, and bites of chicken taco. And she drinks water, which used to be passe in colder climates, and spills it all down her smock, cuz it's cool. She's adjusting to tropical living. She respected me a lot more today, because now I can just say, &quot;Oh, you want to fight with me?&quot; and she realizes she doesn't, so she stops freaking out and lives with the options. Actually I don't think I reminded her that I'm the boss once today, while I said it like 5 times yesterday. I try not to be picky about what she chooses to do. We're just showering her with adult attention and she's feeling very comfortable at this point. Today she said &quot;bye-dios!&quot; again as we left the taco stand. I guess part of her improvements are my own, because I know more how to just take over and refuse to let her flip out, instead insisting that she get in my arms and calm down. She grouses about this powerful voodoo, but it's as if yesterday's mad girl craving freedom has almost totally melted into a curious and calm person who is willing to exert a scintilla of dignified effort for this whole deal called straight-shooting with grown-ups.</p>
<p>Sometimes when I hold Emily I think it's Chloe. I spent all day in their arms.</p>
<h3 id="apr.-23rd-2009">Apr. 23rd, 2009</h3>
<p>Emily is sick with bad allergies. We had a nice dinner. Mexico discovers American hits about 10-20 years later, so we listened to some good 80's hits. Mexico also features the cover tune. Perhaps cover tunes charge lower reproduction rates. Something must explain their plentitude here. Chloe stayed with Mario and Soledad, dancing to Mexican dance pop with Fatima and her friend, and Juan Pablo, who she crushes on. Walking to the third floor at Mario's entails pretty steep cement steps with inlaid stones and random rebar on raw cement slabs where the floor was cut out. Mario made this house, and it's freaking awesome, with a secure outside shop at the first floor, an indoor-outdoorsy kitchen, a beautician studio facing the street, and up the first stairs is a bedroom and kitchen, bathroom with a fishing pole. Up the next stairs is where Mariela lives with Juan Pablo and Fatima, her children. This is the cool part of the house, with awesome views and a cool breeze. Plus the family also occupies the house next door, and is close with the house across the street. My picture doesn't do it justice. It's a great social structure, the block.</p>
<p>I think my host kinda explained the ease of buying ice cream as giving ten pesos to a kid who already has ice cream, and they go get it. What a country!</p>
<p>We went to Costco and it's the same.</p>
<p>I spent a lot of time with Chloe again. Emily thanked me twice for this, but I really like children. What else would I do? There's no way you can ignore a child. They try to make it impossible. Furthermore, Chloe learns every word you provide, I'm a writer, and it's our duty to bring the words.</p>
<p>Emily is sick and it's allergies, and it's pretty serious. I know this stuff. She has a personality like Kim Brown and Ashley, and looks just like them, also. She is tall and strong. We are totally enjoying each other's company, but I don't really know her that well. On the one hand I've known her 20 years, as I've known her whole family that long, but really I just met her 3 days ago. I see her sisters and her mom in her face and eyes all the time.</p>
<p>This evening I said, &quot;Gracias, Amelio.&quot; He's a cool guy who drove Emily and me to dinner. His car is quite nice and his wife is lovely. We all dined in a groovy bar on roast beef sandwiches, nachos with chicken and cheese, and fancy drinks of many sorts. Now we have a good supply of food in the house, from Costco, including lightly sugared crossants.</p>
<p>We get around in a truck with a seat in thet flatbed. There's a canvas just around the seat, giving shelter, but it's a crazy ride anyway, as most of the roads in Puerto Vallarta are inlaid rocks. Certainly this makes bicycle riding more wobbly nobbly.</p>
<p>Emily wants to start a journal. She's asked about mine. I told her highlights, specifically her raven black hair and eyes, and that I spent all day in her and her daughter's arms. She is cute and funny. I'm listening to her cough now and it's really pretty bad. She has allergies here, and now she's getting like bronchitis from them. And it's serious.</p>
<p>She said on Okanawa she was outnumbered by male Marines (like, more than 10 to 1) and that it afforded certain ready options to her. She has a lot of stamina. That would make sense for a Marine I guess.</p>
<p>My bed is pretty cozy, too. We put one of those toppers on the mattress and it's like a hotel bed now. I was sleeping on a hard bed and it was killing me. Exercise has helped a lot.</p>

<p>To my surprise, Chloe gave me a shoulder massage. She's just 22 months old, and I think I taught her some new words, including: goat, sun (and hopefully shade), and the word &quot;yes&quot;. She kinda thought no meant both yes and no. she still does mostly.</p>

<h3 id="apr.-27th-2009">Apr. 27th, 2009</h3>
<p>A longtime friend has engaged a local lady. They both have children, and he has a grandchild. The families are spending a lot of time together as part of the engagement, and her extended family is large and active. I was just along for the ride, until I bonded with his daughter and granddaughter. Most of my time is with those two, acting dadly/manly. But we see our Mexican family at least every other day. And Mexicans just know how to hang out. So we get to hang out, her girls doting on the granddaughter, playing at the beach, going to a casual but upscale restaurant to bond with the cute sister/her husband who drives a nice car and seems super-sweet, or just on the shady sidewalk all evening with some Coronitas (little tiny bottles of Corona beer) and a DJ amp blasting YMCA, and other beloved songs, while the ladies dance.</p>
<h3 id="may.-1st-2009">May. 1st, 2009</h3>
<p>Mexico has great people, great food, a crazy lifestyle of improvisation with the materials at hand.</p>
<p>I haven't had to rely on using another language before. I've travelled but never actually needed/had the local language. Mexico is different, and I am happy to know, you know, 50 words. The whole concept of speaking another language is still sinking in... I understand that look of confusion when people don't know what I'm saying. I've had to give that look before. At the same time I'm here at the house with a girl of almost 2 years who has very similar language challenges. She learns a lot more words each day than I do!</p>
